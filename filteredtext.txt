It directly indicate expected reaction violence following initiation. That said deflagration behavior certainly affected parameters govern reaction initiation. In solid samples e.g. deconsolidated burn front propagated heat flame conducted unburned explosive causing decompose generate gas ignite. A material high ignition temperature TATB requires heat ignition therefore time heat flow slower deflagration rate. In addition grain scale features properties.

Prediction Explosive Insensitivity Based Inherent Material Properties The material properties resulting material behaviors presented discussed form least partial basis determining sensitive insensitive nature explosives. The presence aromatic ring nitro amino groups structure promotes hydrogen bonding absence C-NO2 bonds crystal morphology allows crystal shear without generation high temperatures key molecular crystallographic properties. High thermal conductivity high thermal stability exotherm also dependence DSC onset temperature may also help stabilize explosive materials positive slope onset temperature vs. pressure. ODTX data provide insight thermal sensitivity although result integrated set mechanisms interpretation may misleading e.g. longer reaction times Explosive D apparently dont indicate greater thermal stability low thermal conductivity. Finally pressure-dependent deflagration rate occurrence deconsolidative burning significant effect ultimate reaction violence.

Threshold violence reaction explosives containing cavities adjacent gaps determined compressive loads ranging setback gun projectile supersonic penetration hardened target. Cylindrical samples heavily confined except moveable piston one end. Piston sample pressures always measured along piston motion several experiments follow cavity collapse. With 12.7-mm diameter 6.3-mm deep cylindrical cavity sample 38 explosives examined survived higher loading rates. Usually cast-cure softer pressed explosive would deform without internal damage reaction mild extinguished consuming much sample. Melt-cast harder pressed explosives fracture suddenly vigorously react additional surface area sometimes even exploding. Reaction threshold violence depended energetic ingredients particle size also mechanical properties related type binder fill density. A number operational hazard scenarios involve pressure-time p-t loadings tens microseconds milliseconds peaks tenths GPa. One example inertial loading near bottom explosive fill gun projectile accelerates barrel referred gun setback discussed Detonation Symposia.1-3 Other examples involve impact falling munitions inertial loading explosive fill near nose warhead penetrates barrier. Such loadings well threshold shock initiation dynamic collapse internal cavity cause ignition possibly developing violent reaction. Cavities common include casting voids open cracks aging cycling air gaps interfaces confinement. Since models predicting ignition unavailable full-scale tests expensive difficult instrument simulators used replicate p-t loading within area interest contains cavity.

A Spectrally Encoded Imaging Diagnostic Shock Detonation Physics Experiments Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos New Mexico USA Abstract. A novel diagnostic based spectrally encoded imaging SEI developed shock detonation physics experiments. Depending conguration system diagnostic capable collecting surface breakout data analogous streak framing camera systems. The diagnostic also several key features enable measurements beyond traditional camera systems. Firstly information collected shot transmitted entirely single optical ber. Thus full optical access shot required. As result system elded remote contained facilities gas guns within fully enclosed experimental assemblies. Secondly system non-imaging traditional optics sense. Surface breakout information collected target surfaces shape geometry unlike traditional optical systems must contend optical depth-of-eld issues. As result potential applications new SEI diagnostic endless. A novel chromatism-based surface diagnostic developed supplant replace several conventional high speed imaging diagnostics including streak framing cameras. The goal devise simple ber-based system acquire equivalent imaging data spatial target conguration. Such diagnostic widespread use shock detonation physics experiments surface breakout measurements required. Applications include detonation performance testing measure front curvature detonation velocity inert shock wave experiments. Essentially measurement relies tracking shock wave breakout along material interface possible optical probe-based system developed. Traditional measurements features required use specialized streak framing cameras gold standard. Typically lm-based systems preferred since performance respect resolution dynamic range image distortion still superior digital camera despite recent advances. Unfortunately high speed instrumentation lm cameras produced less frequently remaining manufacturers Kodak becoming exceedingly hard acquire. In general lm must purchased bulk quantities order persuade given manufacturer dedicated production run. Recently last remaining manufacturers beginning deny even limited runs eventually supply instrumentation lm disappear imaging technology fully transitions strictly digital recording. Hard-to-acquire expendable materials lm handicap newly developed technique number key additional advantages make new diagnostic appealing technology offered either traditional lm electronic streak framing The technique fundamentally non-imaging traditional optics sense simply collects spectrally encoded information target surface maps specic geometry target. As long amount light target location collected image surface determined described below. Thus major advantage probe accurately detect surface breakouts along curved oddly shaped surfaces standard optics limited associated depth-of-eld issues. This greatly increases usefulness test especially surface measurements within enclosed assemblies complicated multi-point diagnostics frequently elded measure best discontinuous surface breakout proles. Along lines probe reduce overall number diagnostics needed certain tests taking measurements along multiple surfaces once. For instance probe set measure breakout velocity along edge rate stick simultaneously measuring front curvature breakout end charge. The technique inherently wide range effective magnications determined probe illumination design accommodate small samples necessary without need difcult optical setups. This allows technique acquire measurements previously impossible due imaging space access range limitations. An optical ber run long distance apparent disadvantage pulse dispersion ber. Fortuitously effect essential operation system. So another key advantage non-imaging system requirement full optical access negated. Traditional camera elding requires clear optical access shot.

There number considerations designing probe system. Collecting light along path optimal simple analogous elding typical photonic Doppler velocimetry PDV probe. Depending shape target surface may possible. Odd shaped surfaces scatter illumination different directions. Any amount collectors used though collectors must feed return ber. Convex surfaces require collectors gather dispersed light. In general surface treatments may required ensure light scattered probe collectors locations target. The trade-off much illumination light lost even multiple collectors. These non-specular surfaces correspondingly require illumination power efcient collection designs compensate. return spectra illuminated painted target must measured function time. The return spectrum reected light collected surface probe optics sent system functions high frequency optical spectrum analyzer. Note output traditional spectrometer focused onto electronic streak camera achieve effect continuous measurement. More elegantly though evolving spectra measured pulsed framing mode using dispersive Fourier transform DFT technique.1 Via method possible replace expensive combination spectrometer electronic streak camera simple dispersive ber medium high speed photodetector high speed digitizer channel. Options dispersive ber medium include long length single-mode ber shorter length dispersion compensating ber compact chirped ber Bragg grating FBG. The expensive component system high speed digitizer. Fortuitously instruments already exist facilities PDV capabilities. Note DFT-based system requires target illumination pulsed. Each pulse corresponds acquired frame camera frame rate corresponding laser pulse frequency. As return pulses pass dispersive ber element dispersed opti cally stretched space. For simple dispersion ber disparate wavelengths travel different speeds within optical ber due inherent glass dispersion. This common nuisance telecommunications industry benet DFT system. For long enough bers operation essentially optical Fourier transform. By simply measuring light amplitude function time end dispersive ber optical spectrum pulse accurately measured. Each pulse exiting ber correlates exactly return light spectrum pulse reected target. Note tradeoffs exist pulse rate pulse light bandwidth amount stretch. Essentially return pulses cannot overlap output pulse train. Depending shape nish target surface thus efciency light return pulses dispersed via DFT system may need form amplication photodetection. Although short illumination pulses generated via supercontinuum light source initially high intensity become weaker energy becomes dispersed within ber stretching process. Amplication used multiple locations within system. Inline ber ampliers EDFAs instance may used discrete amplication distributed Raman amplication may used across dispersive ber element itself. In addition amplication options available certain high speed photoreceivers. When shock detonation breaks along sample surface return light eliminated altered. This analogous mirror destruct technique employed typical streak camera operations. Each projected wavelength corresponds unique location sample surface. The geometrical wavelength mapping determined design calibration projection element probe. Dropouts return spectra correlate target surface locations experiencing diminished reectivity.

Optical velocimetry measures component target velocity along axis optical beam. This asset allowing unambiguous interpretation allows laterally moving tilted surface approach probe undetected. In applications important know position target surface forgoing means integrating velocity general give incorrect position. We present preliminary results two approaches overcome limitation amplitude modulation interferometry change path length shows change phase modulation frequency swept optical ranging. Both integrated existing velocimetry probes simultaneous velocity displacement measurements. We also describe 3rd approach desirable features relative first two yet tested. Velocimetry measure full material Briggs et al.

Currently workers must rely assumptions simulations supply missing information experimental technique exists required spatial time resolution track So far paper pointing things widely known. However implications widely appreciated integrating optical velocimetry measurements insufficient determine change distance range target. To measure full target approach rate optically must create effective wavelength greater surface roughness complete measurement time small compared movement target relative illuminated spot. Performance goals proposed methods Our desired spatial resolution 0.1 mm know adequate historical performance electrical shorting pins. We picked measurement frequency 1 MHz give one measurement every millimeter typical speed 1 mms. The time light travel 0.1 mm 0.33 ps. We assume measurements round-trip measurements i.e. beam travels target path typical velocimetry. This means motion 0.1 mm result twice much time elapsed time resolution need measurement strategy 0.67 ps. We describe several methods achieving performance show proof performance Current state-of-the-art oscilloscopes rise time 20 ps slow resolve round trip time resolution need. We propose instead measure average arrival time burst 100 pulses 20 noise 20 ps rise-time give 4 ps resolution individual pulse edge arrival time.

Shock experiments performed plastic bonded explosive PBX LX17 92.5 TATB 7.5 Kel-F binder using single low amplitude shock wave one end cylindrical sample pre-compress material prior detonating LX17 charge end investigate possibility shock desensitization. A 101 mm diameter propellant driven gas gun LX-17 sample containing manganin piezoresistive pressure gauge packages utilized qualitatively measure shock desensitization effects. At pre-shock pressures 0.68 1.1 GPa LX-17 showed failing detonation waves pre-shocked region. However pre-shock pressure 0.52 GPa detonation wave proceeded LX-17. This shock desensitization effect observed explosives containing PBX 9404 Composition B-3. The LX-17 Ignition Growth model including time dependent shock desensitization model used explain rate decay detonation wave shock desensitized LX-17 detonation weakly shocked LX-17. Shock desensitization dead pressing porous solid explosives either useful property one wants prohibit detonation explosive charge unwanted property one requires full detonation charge. In classic paper Campbell Travis PBX 9404 nitrocellulose 3 chloroethylphosphate Composition B-3 60 RDX 40 TNT 1 shown within certain range weak shock strengths pressures sufficient compress voids discontinuities without causing significant exothermic reaction. When detonation waves entered precompressed dead zones extinguished propagation times determined weak shock pressures. For PBX 9404 Composition B-3 measured pressure range shock desensitization 1 2.4 GPa. Below 1 GPa shock waves weak close hot spot sites. The approaching detonation wave falter initiated enough remaining voids discontinuities region. Above 2.4 GPa shock wave strong enough create reacting hot spots provided extra ignition sites oncoming detonation wave. This detonation wave continued propagate fluctuations.

Teflon flyer plates fired low 277 491 ms velocities LX-17 charges. This created weak shocks 0.52 1.1 GPa LX-17 targets. At correct times detonators initiated HMX charges opposite ends LX-17 charges. The HMX detonation waves promptly initiated LX-17 detonation waves interacted weak unreactive shock waves LX-17 within charge. At shock pressures 0.68 GPa failures LX-17 detonation waves occurred within one collision waves. The Ignition Growth calculations predicted detonation wave failures rates decay peak shock pressures shock-desensitized LX-17. At impact shock pressure 0.52 GPa LX-17 detonation wave propagated pre-compressed LX-17. Thus shock desensitization region 0.52 0.68 GPa determined. Figure 1 shows description typical experiment.

Aslam Weapons Experiments Division Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos New Mexico 87545 USA Abstract. A highly accurate numerical shock-tting scheme composed fth order spatial third order temporal discretizations applied two-dimensional reactive Euler equations several models single-step irreversible kinetics slab geometry. The rst case examined calorically perfect mixture ideal gases prescribed material interface motion. The steady detonation phase speed results scheme compared equivalent shock-capturing. It found errors using shock-tting coarser solutions signicantly reduced comparison shock-capturing. Furthermore error order 10 ms similar observed experiments shock-tting offers computational savings order 1000. Additionally behavior detonation phase speed examined several slab widths utilizing Wescott-Stewart-Davis WSD model commonly used high explosive HE modeling evaluate detonation performance PBX 9501. It found thickness effect curve resulting equation state reaction model using published values dramatically steep observed recent experiments. However adjusting reaction rate parameters improves correlation model experimental results. Moreover similar results predicted shock-tting scheme used examine rate stick behavior steady detonation phase speed PBX 9501. Insensitive high explosives IHE 9502 many benets1 however IHEs exhibit longer reaction zones conventional high explosives CHE. This effect making less ideal explosives thus susceptible edge effects. These effects lead considerable performance degradation including detonation speed affected large regions. Aslam et al.2 showed order obtain O50 ms error steady propagating detonation speed using essentially non-oscillatory ENO combination Lax-Friedrichs LF shock-capturing minimum 50 points needed reaction zone. This becomes prohibitively computationally intensive requested error detonation velocity reduced. Additionally many constructions used reactive HE modeling e.g. WSD3 SURF4 CREST5 employ shock-state reaction rates. common practice shock-capturing shock smoothed expense thickening width. Thus induces ambiguity actual shock-state. To remove ambiguity shock-tting used one boundary conditions shocked state detonation front. Furthermore using shock-tting restores potential highly accurate solutions effectively separates ambient upstream smooth reactive ow behind front. The rest paper laid follows. First computational algorithm outlined governing equations associated jump conditions presented initially followed transformation computational domain. This accompanied numerical scheme presented special care near edges HE. This followed comparison steady detonation phase speed shock-tting shockcapturing slab geometry calorically perfect mixture ideal gases previously examined Aslam et al.2 It found required resolution reaction zone HE given error steady detonation phase speed much less shock-tting used. Then shock-tting algorithm used evaluate detonation performance slabs various thickness utilizing realistic WSD equation state model PBX 9501.

The igniter also localized mixture. Fig. 4. Ignition UYZ ring igniter. In spite identical initial conditions differences arise explosion mechanism. Just explosion state mixture two tubes similar UYZ level length. Figure 5a shows two opposite ame fronts start top UYZ. One detonation wave going zone velocity 1200 ms failing junction white zone. The second front goes upwards velocity 380 ms distance 6-7 mm. This record allows one conclude 1 - explosion UYZ results detona tion build-up 2 - transition detonation UYZ fast hardly considered classical deagration detonation transition mechanism secondary explosives 3 - detonation transmitted UYZ white zone means chemical composition cannot detonate. Figure 5b shows explosion starts close bottom UYZ approximately level mark tube. Detonation propagates upwards rst inside UYZ velocity 1700 ms IAN-DCCNa mixture along 2 cm decreasing velocity fails since charge diameter 12 mm signicantly lower critical diameter mixture higher 80 mm Fig. 5.

Experiments b prove lower YZ spite presence chlorinated molecules including possibly N Cl3 explode. In order check whether explosion happen IAN-DCCNa mixtures different composition tested 7030 3070 compositions. In rst experiment performed 10g 7030 IAN-DCCNa mixture nearly length column mixture gure 6a activation igniter result explosion. Gaseous N Cl3 concentration air around igniter probably low. So following experiments performed 5 g mixture gure 7a b igniter placed close top As experiments gure 6 igniter red 2 minutes water injection 0.4 cm3 explosion happened mixtures. Fig. 7.

In case gure 7a UYZ 7030 IANDCCNa mixture less developed color less intense 5050 mixture gure 6a indicates lower production N Cl3 conrming fact explosion happened rst experiment involving 10g mixture. Figure 7b displays different behavior. The top mixture pushed 16 mm intense gaseous production chemical reactions. Contrary previous experiment UYZ reaches top mixture. A longer part tube destroyed explosion. That could due higher gaseous N Cl3 concentration air andor N Cl3 condensation along tube seen gure 7b 2 cm In conclusion UYZ created explodes partly moistened IAN-DCCNa mixtures within large range mixture composition. Strength PMMA low preceding experiments allow appreciate powerful explosion. So experiments similar gure 6 done steel tubes. For purpose 28 g IAN-DCCNa mixture poured steel tube 16 mm internal diameter wall thickness 2 mm 250 mm length. The igniter red 5 minutes water injection 0.9cm3. At moment estimated length UYZ 5 cm. Figure 8 shows case spontaneous explosion focused investigations UYZ. Experiments performed using transparent connement made PMMA glass tubes spontaneous explosion happens easier inside bigger charges internal diameter tubes larger previous experiments. As previously digital video camera 24 imagessecond used record transformations inside mixture water injection high speed camera allowed catch explosive event. As frequency 180000 imagess recording time fast camera 7 necessary reset camera several times experiment risk missing self-ignited explosion. Two experiments presented. They globally show results also differences. In Figure 9 59 g IAN-DCCNa mixture placed glass tube 24 mm internal diameter 250 mm length. Self-ignition happened 1 minute water injection 1.8 cm3. The UYZ well dened. According rst picture series obtained high-speed camera selfignition could happened bottom part UYZ. It generated detonation propagating upwards along UYZ velocity approximately 4000 ms mixture 3 cm mean velocity 1000 ms. As Figure 5b detonation nally failed due small charge diameter comparison critical value detonation propagation. In Figure 10 88 g 5050 IAN-DCCNa mixture used PMMA tube square cross section internal size 25 25 mm. Spontaneous explosion gure 11 happened 50 seconds water injection 2.8 cm3. Comparing last video recorder image explosion images fast camera shows ignition happened UYZ generating upward propagating ame white zone yet formed. Arrival ame UYZ triggers detonation. Detonation velocity zone estimated 4000 ms. Then transmitted detonation 5050 IAN-DCCNa mixture propagated distance least 5 cm 1100 ms failed. A detonation propagated also downwards along 1.5 cm 1800 ms. Fig. 8. Steel connement provoked explosion 5050 IAN-DCCNa mixture To recovered parts tube explosion. The tube exploded along 13 cm two times UYZ length showing detonation UYZ transmitted upwards IANDCCNa mixture. Fragments tube stretched thickness less 1 millimeter. Detonation dry 5050 IAN-DCCNa mixture conned steel tube gave similar fragments proving IAN contained sensitive zone UYZ really detonated. Nevertheless detonation failed since charge diameter 16 mm smaller critical diameter mixture steel connement 21 27 mm. The bottom part steel tube presents deformation proves detonation propagate lower YZ. 3.3. Spontaneous Explosion IAN-DCCNa Mixture Partly Moistened Self-excitation explosion mixture random process important understand least safety point view. In preceding experiments explosion provoked igniter. That allowed determining characteristic aspects mixture relation explosion instance fast detonation transition UYZ. So expecting similar behavior Fig. 9. Spontaneous explosion UYZ 5050 IAN-DCCNa mixture To 19oC. Fig. 10. PMMA tube square cross section. These experiments show self-ignited ame starting somewhere mixture joins UYZ fast transition detonation zone happens transmitting detonation upper mixture. The UYZ plays role booster IAN-DCCNa mixture. The goal last part paper explain UYZ produced. 3.4.

This record conrms previous ones clearly shows formation UYZ white zone. As Fig. 11. Detonation initiation UYZ 5050 IAN-DCCNa mixture To 18oC self-ignited length UYZ increases time 5 cm 14 minutes two times longer 2 minutes mass explosive involved zone also increases improving efciency sustain detonation transmission.

It indicates small temperature increase less 5oC. A slight temperature increase also detected 8th thermocouple. Temperature level 9th one remains nearly constant 20oC initial temperature components spite lower ambient temperature 15oC. Highest temperatures obtained upper part lower YZ. Temperatures UYZ lower maintained long time. These observations indicate heat release mechanisms two zones different. In lower YZ exothermic chemical reactions responsible temperature increase N Cl3 production. Since boiling temperature N Cl3 71oC vapors N Cl3 produced zone temperature higher. At level 2nd 3rd thermocouples temperatures higher 71oC last respectively 4 7 minutes gure 14. The process N Cl3 evaporation seems responsible following events fast temperature decrease level 2nd 3rd thermocouples whitening corresponding zone upward ow gaseous N Cl3 in-between grains mixture resulting condensation N Cl3 grain surfaces formation UYZ subsequent heat release. The temperature increase UYZ always less 70oC due N Cl3 condensation. This testied difference response 4th 5th thermocouple one hand 6th one other. Thermocouple 6 close never gets contact UYZ mixture temperature markedly lower temperature level 4th 5th thermocouples. Since gaseous N Cl3 escapes also mixture temperature increase indicated thermocouples 7 8 could due ow hot gaseous products may N Cl3 condensation. The bottom mixture remains yellowish temperature nearly always smaller 70oC. Nevertheless vapor pressure N Cl3 rather high2 20.27 kPa 20oC gaseous N Cl3 ow upwards zone. All experiments presented allow describing mechanism involved spontaneous explosion partly moistened 5050 IAN-DCCNa Chemical reactions start soon water injected mixture. The color zone passes rapidly white yellowish indicating production chlorinated molecules like N Cl3. The temperature upper part zone higher 71oC boiling temperature N Cl3 several minutes gaseous N Cl3 convected outside reaction zone upper dry AN-DCCNa mixture temperature signicantly lower. So gaseous N Cl3 condensates AN DCCNa grains generating UYZ corresponding temperature increase. This mechanism operate throughout lot minutes least moment spontaneous explosion length UYZ increases. Due high vapor pressure gaseous N Cl3 escapes mixture possible initiate explosion heating device localized centimeters top mixture. Experiments clearly show provoked self-ignition detonation always builds propagates UYZ whatever studied AN type IAN AAN composition ANDCCNa mixture. The state steel tube explosion shows material contained UYZ underwent violent exothermic chemical reaction. In experiments detonation velocity UYZ estimated 4000 ms value close ideal detonation velocity liquid N Cl3 3980 ms.7 So leading detonation UYZ could lm liquid N Cl3 sustaining detonation eventually sensitized AN-DCCNa In experiments detonation UYZ transmitted IAN-DCCNa mixture failed short propagation distance since size charge signicantly smaller critical diameter. In fact propagation distance detonation increases size charge 2 cm 12 mm diameter charge g 415 ure 5b 5 cm charge 25 mm square cross section gure 11. In charges size bigger critical diameter transmitted detonation UYZ consumes mixture without failure. This conrmed unpublished results steel tubes 42 mm internal diameter lled 5050 IANDCCNa mixture.

Aluminum Al added explosive formulations based TNT RDX HMX attempt increase blast energy tailor explosives blast-pressure pulse. The detonation pressure materials lower might expected even though subsequent reactions generate aluminum oxide Al2O3 exothermic sub-oxides AlO Al2O condensed-phase products form endothermic reduce detonation pressure. Because initial reactions involving HMX energetic fast reactions involving aluminum net endothermic due decrease gas volume also slow model weak detonation required describe explosives. We present engineering analysis typical explosive class demonstrate means accompanying numerical simulations three component reactive flow model fast exothermic step intermediates followed slower endothermic step final products produces weak detonation. Aluminum Al added explosive formulations based TNT RDX HMX attempt increase blast energy tailor explosives formulations used underwater enhanced blast applications many years. However studies performed early 1950s demonstrated even though explosives Al benefit higher initial density typically leads higher pressures velocities detonation performance suffered. It materials lower equivalent mixture explosive inert diluents sand see Cook et. al1. This occurs reactions oxygen O2 detonation pressure suboxides AlO Al2O etc. endothermic subsequent reactions generate aluminum oxide Al2O3 although exothermic produce condensed-phase product serves reduce detonation pressure well. The particle size Al used historically order 10-100 microns larger either flake spherical. Because low surface area using particles advantage producing mixture easy formulate relatively large mass difficult ignite. Thus reaction aluminum occurs long RDX HMX detonation reaction zone passes energy release aluminum contribute progression shock produces late-time effects.

For longer reaction times compared induction times lowering product activation energy ratio induction reaction time leads stability. For shorter reaction times compared induction times lowering activation energy alone leads stability. All unstable numerical solutions calculated periodic limit-cycle. However increasing activation energy ratio induction reaction time well beyond stability boundary leads progressively stiff evolution equation becomes unsolvable current numerics used. In induction zone small perturbation leads large change induction time owing high activation energy turn increases amount reactants effectively amplifying shock front conservation law.

Introduction Detonation Connement The Velocity Detonation VOD High Explosive HE charge generally expected increase encased conning material. That said many charges large enough detonation propagates nearly Chapman-Jouguet CJ speed even bare. strong connement barely increases VOD. For example 1-inch-dia. HMX-based bare rate stick propagates nearly CJ speed. Consequently VOD hardly affected conning thick copper Cu tube used standard Cylinder Expansion CYLEX test. bare 1-inch-dia. PBX 9502 95 wt TATB 5 wt binder charge detonates 7.6 mms whereas estimated CJ VOD 7.8 mms. Here margin one would expect corresponding CYLEX VOD lie two values. In reality although lot effects fully sorted 9502 CYLEX VOD higher remains 7.6 mms. Thus real connement effects complex non-intuitive. We discuss reasons present experimental data several important carefully controlled conned PBX 9502 congurations. Physical Origins Detonation Wave Connement Distinction Product Connement Figure 1 shows schematic drawing CYLEX test emphasis placed upon wave structure.

This compliance constitutes connement loss relative rigid boundary would unyielding. The oblique shock reects tube free-surface expansion wave structure continues reverberate tube wall alternating sign diminishing effect. Fig. 1.

Downstream detonation shock within reaction zone lies sonic surface ahead ow inuences drives detonation shock behind not. The material interface deection alters ow pattern shock sonic surface turn affects shock shape VOD. The material interface deection lies values corresponding two physical limits innite connement i.e. rigid wall one end zero connement other. The unconned limit correspond bare charges vacuum one might suppose instead shall see may occur variety relatively insubstantial materials include air foams plastics rubbers. This zero detonation connement actually occurs response conner causes sonic surface meet detonation shock charge edge. However condition achieved effect isolate shock lateral downstream surroundings thus causing propagate shape VOD charge bare surroundings evacuated. If head rst expansion wave returning tube free-surface intersects material interface downstream point sonic surface meets latter drawn Fig. 1 detonation shock inuenced freesurface. Consequently effect detonation wall thickness innite. There exists critical conning-layer thickness two features meet material inter face axial location. For smaller layer thicknesses connement effect decreases layer thickness decreases vanishing latter approaches zero. Thin-wall behavior probably intuitive thick-wall behavior qualitatively like familiar detonation product Whereas detonation wave connement affects detonation propagation detonation product connement constrains lateral product expansion. This effect operates much larger times distances purely one mass loading. Consequently depend wall density thickness alone product two. More specically Gurney analysis tells us product connement depends conner-to-HE-mass ratio. Detonation Wave Connement DSD Model Detonation Shock Dynamics DSD hierarchical approximation reactive Euler equations used propagate curved detonation waves 1. The simplest widely-implemented variant propagates waves single mathematical functioncalled intrinsic relationwhich relates local normal component detonation speed Dn local total curvature . DSD theory goes far reveal functional dependence quasiunique Dn expression. Its mathematical shape must discovered experimentally. Besides calibrated Dn curve considered HE DSD generally needs angle boundarycondition BC charge edge. The exception angle edge emerging wave less sonic angle value occurs edge bare rate stick. For supersonic BCs emerging wave sense presence charge edge propagates charge continued indenitely. Supersonic BCs commonly occur congurations detonation rst-breakout tangential point charge surface. cases angle wave edge zero rst emergence generally increases intersection point propagates outward.

This important sub-problem considered solved PBX 9502 previously measured fronts-value two rather different methods curvature rate stick 3 failure cone 4. Both yielded s-values see Figs. 1 2 35. Model Connement-Prescriptions RBM vs DSD Reactive Burn Models RBMs simulate connement effects directly computing details like rendered Fig. 1. This method pros cons. The main advantage automation one enters best-known material properties HE conner pops result. For example layer thickness less critical value consequences directly simulated. No connement calibration necessary RBMs able directly incorporate them. A disadvantage RBMs one may computing power spatially resolve thin conning layers much less generate interior physical details see Fig. 1 inuence connement. A prediction made may realistic. Another RBM shortfall real-world connement affected subtler phenomena like air foam rubber gapswhich RBMs generally cannot resolveand viscosity heat conduction HE granularitywhich RBMs treat. Because DSD model simpler RBM models connement prescription must invoke direct experimental calibration. By naturally incorporates multiple real-world connement effectswhich may understood even necessarily identiedin way RBMs cannot. Thus DSD much computationally efcient RBM models also accurate problems. From point forward shall consider DSDlevel detonation wave connement matter complex conner structure simply quantied c-value associated HEconner pair.

There exists occasional misconception connement effect depends acoustic impedance conner.

The simplest theoretical construct shock polar analysis introduced gasdynamics Busemann 1931 5. Though details murky likely rst adapted HE von Neumann connection HE lensing contributions Manhattan project 6.

Aslam Bdzil compared polytropic-EOS polars numerical simulations 8 subsequent LANL work 9-12 expressed polars terms Up-Us Hugoniots directly incorporate available shock wave data. We outline concepts assumptions. Causality ensures two shocks meet material interface. The HE cannot react instantly virtually inert neighborhood node point two shocks material interface meet. Material strength much smaller pressure imparted detonation thus deviatoric stresses neglected. Both materials assumed possess Up-Us Hugoniot. Under assumptions one may derive parametric pressureshock-deection-type polar curve material relates ow pressure P streamline deection angle . Its form unimportant present discussion given 10. The two materials assumed intimate contact must both. And material strength negligible materials behave uids material interface cannot support stress differential. Hence P materials neighborhood interface. These dual physical requirements simultaneously satised P curves two materials cross. For reason gasdynamic parlance calls P - space match plane. We shall discuss details three essential shock-polar scenarios previously named Strong Weak Stiff connement 8 context specic examples. Figure 4 overlays PBX 9502 red Tantalum Ta blue polars.

As DSD requires relevant data conned detonation experiments. Real-World Effects Detonation Connement Shock polar theory assumes material layers assembly ideal. Because never true real devices appreciation non-ideal effects essential design effective detonation connement experiments. Next discuss two general causes connement non-ideality. Gaps Between HE Conner Liquids cast-cure granular HEs generally poured containerconner. Because uid gap discounting possible cast-cure shrinkage forms HE container. Likewise putty-like HE materials may packed container without gaps. For solid explosive pieces however gaps generally exist HE intended wave conner. For example HE cylinders red tube insertion tolerance necessary keep charges binding. For standard 1-in-dia. CYLEX test nominal tolerance-gap 1 In scenarios insertion toler13 m. ances far generous. Even slab congurations gaps usual situation surfaces extremely uniformly loaded. Although O10 gap seems diminutive comparable PBX 9501 95 wt HMX 5 wt binder CJ reaction zone thickness CJ 25 13. From Fig. 1 associated discussion substantial isolation detonation conner expected cases. For PBX 9502 however CJ O1000 m. By CJ measuring-stick argument one would expect O10 air gap compromise connement yet noted 1 negligible effect realized CYLEX. The likely reason fact 9502 HMX-like reaction-zone component e.g. WSD model 14 CJ half-reaction thickness 30 followed long tail. The fast component may control wave connement. There another possible explanation. Detonation products jet ahead even narrow gaps 15 gasses might pre-shock deaden insensitive TATB-based HE near charge edge. Reaction quenching even retardation edge layer would slow detonation. It conceivable connement jetting effects virtually cancel 9502 CYLEX tests. Material Non-Ideality Most PBX formulations composed crystalline HE grains interspersed binder machined surface roughness comparable If detonation reaction substantially homogeneous PBX 9501 conned scenarios 13 grain size exceed CJwhich 9501 4. Thus machined surface roughness causes OCJ RMS gap thickness. In contrast insensitive PBX 9502 reacts quite heterogeneously 16 meaning reaction spreads hottest regions consume interstitial material. Because hot spot locations tied heterogeneous HE microstructure one argues CJ unlikely sub-grain-scaleas indeed full 9502 reaction zone not. Consequently surface roughnesses well-machined 9502 parts much smaller CJ. If excellent conner contact achieved hotspot criticality might altered high thermal conductivity conner. Like product-jet deadening effect would quench retard reaction HE edge layer thickness would On13 n supercritical hot spot number density n13 tied microstructure.

Each layer must made quite parallel. Even edge-clamped assemblies bow outward middle rather applying pressure needed. A common practice apply grease material layers eliminate air gaps. This practice disallowed wave connement tests. It clear demonstrated 6 even thin material layers alter HE connement properties. Contact must clean dry uniform. One may therefore ask grease layer recommended CYLEX test. The reason CYLEX primarily product connement test wave connement test. Consequently main goal maintain product connement preventing tube wall breaking prematurely.

In carbon rich explosive time scale several microseconds soot growth dependence local thermodynamic conditions may produce difference energy release expansion detonation products various size devices. We aim testing effect TATB-based explosive. We designed homothetic cylinder test 50 20 10mm copper aluminum liners. The PDV signal recorded opposite sides device average Gurney energy drawn along volume variation cylinder. We show discrepancy projection energy smaller cylinders compared larger ones. This lack energy ascribed difference carbon properties cluster size carbon phase soot along detonation products. This complex problem approximated empirical kinetic evolution carbon phase transition detonation products. This model permits reproduce behavior energy quenching observed need exploration reproduce measures liners. metric diamond particles recovered detonation soot3. The diamond phase produced high pressure temperature reaction zone around CJ point. The reasons diamond phase found soot meta-stable normal condition ii thermodynamic equilibrium satisfied along isentropic expansion otherwise graphite phase found. So transformation soot. Because carbon phases difference internal energy volume carbon phase size cluster may surrounding gas energy retrieved expansion detonation products. Thus difference expansion process may influence energy released products. This phenomenon believed part non-ideal behavior detonation propagation energy volume Carbon rich explosives TATB create large amount soot detonation products. The soot mainly composed carbon clusters sequester certain amount energy liberated heat detonation form surface internal energy carbon clusters1 clusters vary size structure carbon phase. time scale carbon clustering2 compared reaction zone processes releases part energy surrounding gas far behind detonation front. This process depends local thermodynamic conditions detonation products rapid drop conditions may stop cluster evolution trap part energy.

This paper discuss experimental observation thermodynamic state variables thermal decomposition evolution thermal explosion energetic materials. We discuss continuous measurement observables across time scales bridging pre-ignition thermal decomposition regime postignition burn propagation regimes. Techniques measuring temperature density pressure continuously discussed results presented thermal explosions HMX based formulation PBX-9501. Comparisons observables rates change discussed. These observations used offer definition ignition distinguishes slow processes thermal decomposition heating switch fast consumption solid internal burning. The response energetic materials temperature occurs time scales ranging microseconds hours. This represents dynamic range nearly 10 orders magnitude time making energetic materials extremely challenging study experimentally computationally. Experimentally following observables microsecond resolution durations hours typically possible. Current treatments cleave problem regimes slow pre-ignition regime lasting hours evolving time scale seconds fast post-ignition regime lasting hundreds microseconds order microseconds. Computationally change time scales treated handing problem preignition models post-ignition burn propagation models typically pressure dependent programmed burn. While considering response different time regimes evolve different rates logical approach material actually evolves continuously pre post ignition regimes. We attempted provide sufficient heating rates accelerate decomposition generate thermal explosion. The onset thermal explosion often called ignition. Although word ignition used distinguishing behavior pre- post- ignition difficult exact meaning ignition well agreed upon likely depends observables used discussed sections below.

However model constructed coefficients depend upon explosive one set experiments used find coefficients thereafter least principle model used predict threshold type impact particular explosive. The following discusses attempts construct Projectile Free Models There least three attempts construct projectile-free model describe shock initiation threshold. In energy supplied HE described terms shock strength generated within explosive i.e. impact velocity projectile converted HE shock parameters via impedance mismatch technique knowledge projectile HE non-reactive Hugoniots10.

To find maximum volume differentiate respect time set differential Setting term square brackets zero gives D6c note setting Rct 10 gives time volume zero. Hence rods The leading edge rarefaction reached radius 2R3 time. For given impact velocity maximum volume threshold boundary set maximum volumes increasing size resulting projectiles increasing diameter cause initiation velocity. In fact maximum volume threshold minimum volumes able cause initiation impact velocity. This threshold value referred critical volume. If impact velocity increased critical volume decrease minimum volume possible rod impacts cause initiation velocity. A circular disc diameter D thickness act either rod flyer depending upon ratio D. The cross-over two behaviours stems fact ensured Ec types projectiles impacting explosive. So cross-over given impact For flyer threshold given velocity D larger obtained equation 13 otherwise projectile must counted rod. This means given impact velocity flyer must also volume non-divergent flow larger critical volume associated rod simply need flyer larger value D note cannot reduce volume reducing since would violate flyer threshold. The flyer threshold minimum time cause initiation i.e. old Walker-Wasley definition duration. There flyers longer durations given velocity threshold. So cross-over rod flyer thresholds projectile minimum time minimum shock volume impact velocity cause initiation. If keep velocity constant increase D projectile becomes flyer already satisfied critical shock volume criterion larger volume needed cause initiation also needs satisfy minimum duration depends ensure initiation proceeds. If hand increase keep D cross-over value satisfied minimum time increasing need ensure critical volume requirement satisfied. Consequently James Criterion projectile satisfy minimum duration critical shock volume requirements initiation proceed. Failing either means non-initiation takes place. Turning around means given impact James Criterion implies initiation take place given critical volume explosive exposed non-divergent shock least part volume undergone given minimum shock duration.

For characterization thermal sensitivity explosives different types tests developed past. In cookoff tests explosive sample slowly heated critical explosive determined. For classical cookoff tests electronic heat sources radiant heaters normally applied controlled give well-defined heating rate. Two examples cookoff tests mark range typical heating rates The Scaled Thermal Explosion Experiment STEX1 applies external temperature increase 0.0003 Cs.

In addition potential experimental work towards development numerical simulations laser cookoff tests taking account temperature- pressure-dependent reaction rates discussed first approaches numerical simulation developed. Scientific Background When referring thermal mode laser initiation-as opposed shock initiation using intense laser pulses678 build upon extensive literature classic thermal ignition also work laser ignition. A thermally initiated reaction explosive also called cookoff divided preignition represents phase ignition explosive material. Here ignition defined point time reaction becomes selfsustaining. In postignition regime strength violence reaction interest. In literature different techniques used approximations made model two cookoff regimes. The preignition phase mostly approximated thermal-chemical coupled problem example Zinn Mader10.

Likewise analyzing Los Alamos Radial Cookoff tests23 Asay et al. 24 stated fast cookoff usually less violent slow cookoff reaction starts surface probe instead center. These observations lay foundations interpreting results laser initiation tests intense laser irradiation causes rather fast heating.

In analyzing trend results factors determining ignition growth reaction must considered. The spigot driven HE impact projectile fired around 105ms gas gun. As diameter spigot increased x Amount damaged HE immediately beneath around spigot increased. This promote ignition x Amount damaged material sides spigot wall test vehicle decreased. Hence amount material available reaction growth For spigots small diameters small volume HE compressed causing chemical decomposition however insufficient energy released enable significant growth reaction occur. Increasing spigot diameter increases volume HE compressed damaged impact although degree decomposition may less due impact energy deposited larger area. This increase decomposition volume decreases deflagration detonation distance. However spigot diameter increased also reduces amount HE spigot wall test vehicle available burn increase deflagration detonation distance. There critical diameter beyond reduction amount HE spigot wall test vehicle initial volume initiated dominates increase volume damaged material.

A Mesh-free DSD Front Tracker Arbitrary HE Boundary Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Livermore California U.S.A Abstract. A new mesh-free DSD front tracker explicitly solves detonation front propagation implemented arbitrarily specified HE boundary. Compared previously existing mesh-based DSD implementations new method advantages reduced cost improved accuracy minimized data space enhanced capabilities. The new DSD front tracker puts marked particles HE front tracks motion particles front normal direction governed time-dependent ODE system. The difficulty associated implicit DSD boundary treatment much reduced explicit methodology arbitrarily specified HE boundary geometry. The issue associated change front topology resolved efficient local inclusion test. Particles redistributed front maintain desired resolution. This DSD front tracker validated comparisons exact reactive flow solutions rate-stick problems. In addition shown capable dead-zone simulation. Programmed HE burn detonation shock dynamics DSD model efficient method lighting time calculation compared reactive flow modeling requires high resolution reaction zone. Existing DSD implementations solve level-set PDE equivalent PDE mesh apply angle condition HEinert boundary. Among existing DSD algorithms finite-difference method easily performed Cartesian mesh. However treatment becomes complicated detonation front HE boundary implicitly defined 1 2. With renormalization distance field narrowband methodology reduce cost would converge true solution even relatively trivial concave geometry 3. Another method using least-squared fitting lighting front existing hydro mesh also implemented narrowband fashion boundary condition still difficult apply even HE boundary explicitly specified body-fitting mesh 4. Because mesh resolution cannot adjusted local high curvature regions cannot resolved mesh-based DSD method. In addition meshbased method requires relatively big storage space. To reduce difficulties mentioned DSD algorithm detonation front HE boundary explicitly expressed becomes desirable. Such method may provide easier boundary treatment adjustable local resolution accurate efficient solution smaller data space. Recently implemented mesh-free DSD arbitrarily specified HE boundary. The new detonation front according tracks particles distributed tracker called SDOT curvature law curved fitting neighbor particle positions express local front geometry. The DSD boundary angle condition used explicitly derive position boundary particle. The challenge topology change treated dropping lit run boundary particles reassigning neighbors particles lost neighbors. A redistribution particles performed condition based distance curvature maintain front quality. With new algorithm need solve governing nonlinear PDE previous implemented DSD methods. Instead set timedependent ODEs derived DSD evolution equation 5 solved advancing detonation front. This PDE ODE conversion third order accurate space introduces error time. In article describe mathematical aspects numerical techniques front motion topology change boundary treatment surface management associated mesh-less DSD front tracker. Some 2D numerical examples verify validate new method follow. HE Boundary Presentation Fixed Control Points Define Boundary Faces In practice boundary geometry usually specified set control points rule connect define boundary faces. For example rate-stick geometry described four control points define four faces. To define boundary two-dimensions control points ordered counter-clock-wise pair two consecutive points defining boundary face. A face planar curved depending whether continuity slope control point consideration. In axisymmetrical geometry faces faces two-dimensions revolved around axis. Rather complicated boundary geometry may defined small set control points seen numerical examples article. The smallness boundary data usually true threedimensions well.

In intrinsic normal coordinate front geometry generally expressed n h neighborhood P. Here assume surface represents detonation front sufficiently smooth define curvature. Such surface may take form Taylor expansion third order spatial accuracy format Where coefficients b c e f considered functions time carrying change geometry detonation front. To order care local geometry would symmetry n-axis coordinate A reduced form front expansion eq. 2 surface normal coordinate derived. Let us consider time T0. Without loss generality T0 set 0.

Rearranging particles tends smooth front would also help stabilize numerical scheme. However time step limited order avoid unnecessary reordering neighbor particles. For purpose testing taken constant time steps. We performed global linear stability analysis new tracking algorithm. However believe stability condition derived 1 sensible choice limiting time steps.

When particle located cube sliced either HE boundary detonation front check relative position boundary front particles contained local inclusion test inside unit cube only. This approach makes inclusion test efficient. The size virtual cube lc fraction volume HE region divided surface boundary cubes cubes crossed boundary need tested inclusion boundary faces cross cube contains given particle. These virtual cubes used later local neighbor search help interpolation lighting times. Because virtual cubes crossed boundary front need stored given time-step data storage virtual cubes also small.

A Small Data Space Reduced Complexity In practice ignorable storage needed specifying boundary geometry. Furthermore time step information needed advance front carried positions particles current front. Compared mesh-based DSD method spatial complexity reduced dimension.

Smirnov Russian Federal Nuclear Center All-Russian Research Institute Technical Physics Snezhinsk Russia Lavrentiev Institute Hydrodynamics Novosibirsk Russia Novosibirsk State University Novosibirsk Russia Abstract. The work presents results experiments shock front dynamics polymer bonded TATB ultrafast multi-shots one-dimensional method based use synchrotron radiation. This method allows us determine Hugoniot data reactants registration direct reected shock waves samples. The absence intensive chemical reaction observed experiment. Experimental studies shock wave process high explosives HE usually carried determine Hugoniots equations state reactants detonation products. When intensity shock wave high enough shock detonation transition SDT problem determine reactants-to-products ratio behind shock front arises. To exclude inuence chemical reaction example possible measure state reactants nearest impact zone SDT process initial stage. In present report shock response TATBbased charges different porosity determined synchrotron radiation1 SR shock wave propagation sample impact boundary. This ultrafast multi-shots method allows one register appearing shock wave also state substance behind shock front 10 passing. Such information could used data make statement presense intensive chemical reaction words SDT process absence. Thus determined state substance corresponds either pure reactants compound reactants products. The registration ow arising passing shock front done determining presence intensive chemical reaction. When shock wave reaches boundary HE charge massive steel base reected back. It well known shock sensitivity porous charge HE decreased loading weak shock wave therefore pressure reected wave front could higher single wave front case intensitive chemical reaction might arise. The experimental study devoted X-raying SR beam HE sample impact metal striker. The passing radiation contains data amount substance along beam line Fig. 1. 1 - detonator 2 - explosive lens 3 - additional charge 4 - obturator 5 - SR beam 6 - striker 7 - SR beam detector 8 - sample 9 - steel base. recordered one-dimensional multi-shots detector. The shock front posisiton well dened signicant local attenuation intensity due compression substance. The metal striker absorbes SR radiation almost completely hence boundaries well dened too. The measured thickness striker SR means must equal initial one. Otherwise means rotation destruction striker. The intensive chemical reaction leads signicant side expansion products behind shock front. It could determined increasing intensity passing radiation zone. The scheme experiment shown g. 1.

Since striker started detector 7 began registration intensity passing radiation SR The passing radiation registered onedimensional x-ray movie. The spacial resolution 0.1 mm temporal one 0.496 s. The exposure time 1 ns. Fig. 2 shows experimental data intensity direct reected shock waves. The shock front positions propagation directions marked arrows.

The results experiment represented x-t diagram shock front striker It possible change striker speed impact varying mass. So speed striker neccessary arise SDT direct reected shock waves determined. To obtain parameters compressed reactants use data experiments SDT process appear reected waves. In last case get data calculations Fig. 3. SDT process.

The SDT process reected wave appears speed striker impact approximately 1.5 2 kms depending porosity samples. If speed striker larger 2 kms SDT would appear direct wave prorsity studied samples If speed striker low compression shock wave enough obtain high contrast signals determine front position. So speed lower 0.5 kms front position cannot derived prosity samples. Thus range pressure front direct wave mea sure state reactants restricted. But time pressure reected wave practically doubles sensitivity previously compressed samples lower. This enables increase signicantly upper limit pressure compressed state reactants without arising intensive The x-t diagrams obtained used determine velocities shock front striker impact corresponds mass velocity substance behind shock wave according Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. However way determination mass velocity could include signicant systematic error. Basically shock wave propagating striker velocity aluminium high occurs impact. The shock wave goes free surface striker reects rarefaction wave. This wave reach striker-sample boundary microsecond depending thickness striker. After speed strikersample boundary becomes lower mass velocity. During time one two experimental points x-t diagram usually measured insufcient determine correctly speed striker. The larger thickness striker could cause increasing time interval arrival expansion wave case speed becomes lower gain additional charge mass increase strikers speed resulted bulk debris. They would move faster striker cause trouble correct registration In paper take account expansion wave construction parametric equation states EOS HE like Mie-Gruneisen one used solve one-dimension Riemann problem Godunovs scheme n CV G set variable parameters considered constant. The calculations x-t diagrams processes experimental conditions porosity carried according EOS simple equations central part shock front sample earlier. The inuence wave arising ow considered paper. To avoid signicant systematic error lengths samples twofold lower diameter. The inuence wave side rarefaction also increasing curvature shock front shock wave passes along sample. This leads attening jump SR beam intensity shock front. Hence several cases reliable registration reected shock front position The Hugoniots Us Up P coordinates different initial porosity samples shown gs. 6 7 respectively.

Therefore method construction EOS allow one determine isoterm temperature shock compressed reactants Hugoniots Us Up coordinates obtained. Comparison calculated experimental x-t diagrams shown g. 5. The kink point striker movement diagram correspons time rarefaction wave reaches striker-sample boundary. This wave overtake direct shock wave front sample. However case present experimental conditions relation striker sample sizes side rarefaction wave reach When shock front goes sample-steel base boundary reects back sample shock wave. This reected wave moves along In reected shock wave front pressure signicantly increases according HE desensitising SDT process might case. This make possible expand range pressure get data shock compressed reactants. For tested samples pressure von Neumann vN spike 40 GP maximum pressure reected wave reactants 25 GP g. 8. The sipmlied version Mie-Gruneisen EOS leads linear relationship Us Up Hugoniot. At time well known low mass velocity relation several HE nonlinear. This feature taken account complicating form EOS involves increasing number parameters. For example Wescott Stewart Davis3 model reactants contains 8 parameters derived experiment. Fig. 6.

As see range pressure less 5 GP appropriate use methods determine shock response present time. Widening range pressure method lower values reached enlarging diameter samples results reducing curvature shock front. It would lead increasing intensity jump shock front. This require higher intensity energy SR beam. Presently active works carried direction. The reected waves always move along compressed sample.

Non-ideal explosives including ammonals tend exhibit increased energy output diameter charge increased. tests results increasing cylinder-wall velocities increasing cylinder-test diameter. This phenomenon related well-known diameter effect refers increase detonation velocity diameter explosive charge increased. While diameter effect detonation velocity observed ideal non-ideal explosives effect diameter wall velocity cylinder test depends promptness reaction following lead shock detonation. An ideal explosive reacts quickly sonic surface would exhibit nearly identical scaled wall-velocity proles across range cylinder-test diameters whereas non-ideal explosive exhibiting slower reactions tends produce increased wall velocities diameter increased. This effect attributed higher post-sonic-surface temperatures enable higher late reaction rates.

Hot spots formed example micron-sized pores contained within energetic crystals collapsed shock wave loading. In work numerical model used simulate pore collapse chemical reactions shockloaded -HMX crystal.

Chemical reactions freeze-out carbon kinetics usually assumed include nucleation phase transformation coagulation long invoked explain deviations energy delivered detonating explosives e.g. measured cylinder experiments ideal behavior. Chemical equilibrium hydrodynamic calculations cylinder detonation PETN high energy low carbon content explosive show gas phase chemistry freeze-out major effect determining energy output probably occurs relatively low temperatures 1500K proposed decades ago. In carbon producing explosives often modeled using full chemistry freeze-out temperatures higher 2000K chemical reactions condensed carbon gas products likely limiting steps energy release. Indeed comparisons calculated recovered carbon amounts indicate temperatures around 2300K. Hydrodynamic simulations using simple chemical kinetics model transfer carbon gas phase reproduce energy output carbon production TNT graphite-producing explosive COMP-B diamond-producing explosive. Calculations also include diamond - graphite phase transformation suggest relatively small contribution energy output. A new carbon aggregation model introduced parameterized using experimental data full application detonation requires additional experimental andor simulation guidance. likely slowdown significantly The properties detonating high explosives determined complex physical chemical phenomena yet fully elucidated therefore remain challenging predict high accuracy. The amount experimental data accumulating halfcentury variety energetic materials undergoing detonation considerable albeit primarily focused quantities direct practical relevance e.g. detonation velocity wall velocity cylinder experiments etc. Current methods modeling detonation 1-5 aim organize correlate experimental recent simulational observations 6 according fundamental physics chemistry principles thus develop understanding goes beyond usual parameterizing empirical models individual explosives based experimental data. The ability predict explosive behavior e.g. momentum energy delivered wide range practical conditions sometimes even absence assumption chemical equilibrium detonation conditions proved fruitful modeling approach particularly combined theories detonation statistical mechanics equilibrium picture emerged last decade reacting CHNO explosives especially accurate quantum molecular dynamics traditional one envisions rapid formation stable molecular products H2O N2 CO2 CO etc. Ionic products turn example play major role determining behavior high pressures temperatures 6 7. It important incorporate concepts faithfully possible prediction detonation properties two main reasons. First chemical equilibrium approach though principle well defined thermodynamic standpoint 8 truly predictive describes actual state system terms species abundance equation state. Second although chemical equilibrium may applicable conditions serves fundamental reference state realistic representation essential building predictive chemical physical kinetics models. The latter reason particularly important energy delivery calculations often involve expanded lower pressure temperature thermodynamic states may reach partial chemical equilibrium whose properties determined slow kinetic effects. Since typical CHNO explosives negative oxygen balance thus produce condensed carbon carbon kinetics effects usually assumed encompass nucleation phase transformation coagulation long recognized playing important role determining detonation properties energy output materials 9-13. The socalled freeze-out chemical reactions low temperatures also often invoked virtually explosives reconcile chemical equilibrium predictions observed long time detonation calorimetry energy output 1415. In following employ modern chemical equilibrium methods realistic speciation hydrodynamickinetics calculations understand relationship two effects ideal non-ideal explosives. We find reaction products amounts particular slowdown chemical reactions gas phase unlikely play dominant role energy release condensed carbon production reactions gas products major constraints predicting performance explosives. We illustrate calculations PETN TNT COMP-B. We also discuss effect diamond graphite transformation potential contribution carbon aggregation late time energy release context new kinetic Chemical kinetics effects energy release Standard detonation theory proposed Chapman Jouguet detonation chemistry set reactions occurring behind leading shock front involve primarily small molecular products resulting fast decomposition energetic material expected equilibrate nanosecond sub-nanosecond time scales resulting reaction zones orders magnitude millimeter essentially ideal behavior normal charge sizes i.e. centimeters large. Not surprisingly behavior associated high energy content explosives almost oxygen balanced PETN prototypical example. performed last decade 67 confirm large extent predominance fast chemical reactions materials also provide evidence reactivity high pressures occurrence charged species e.g. H OH- etc. Statistical mechanics models complex fluid mixtures containing uncharged charged components developed systematically accounting short range e.g. exp-6 electrostatic dipolar induction polarization interactions Helmholtz free molecular products energy Ffluid written contributions 1-517 statistical mechanics description detonation products CHNO explosives Gs Gibbs free energies Gnanocarbon sum condensed phases diamond graphite liquids ni set numbers moles molecular species fluid phase condensed carbon phases.

The stable gaseous molecular products N2 H2O CO2 CO recovered PETN detonation calorimeter experiments 14 following full expansion VV0200 re-equilibration long - tens minutes - time scales. Comparisons recovered quantities simple chemical equilibrium estimates expected amounts used suggest reactions essentially cease temperatures approximately 1500K-1800K. This model fluid gaseous detonation products currently realistic picture chemical speciation thermodynamics pressure temperature conditions encountered Since high explosives characterized overabundance carbon therefore detonation results production condensed thermodynamic description reacted state also needs include appropriate models carbon phases. They typically parameterized shockwave phase diagram experimental data 18-20. The production condensed phases poses conceptual challenge C-J detonation picture since occurrence bulk form necessarily much slower chemical reactions involving small molecular products would therefore seem imply large reaction zones. High explosives low moderate negative oxygen balance e.g. HMX nevertheless behave quite ideally suggesting C-J framework remains large extent valid. These two observations reconciled nucleation processes leading appearance condensed phases assumed rapid chemical equilibrium C-J state achieved small nano-sized nuclei bulk phases 13. In fact much better calculations experiments obtained shock behavior variety carbon-rich compounds condensed carbon assumed produced form particles size nanometers surface free energy contributions important small clusters suitably taken account 13.

Precise comparisons detonation calorimeter recovered gas products calculations however difficult since significant chemistry may occur experiments full expansion.

It worth noting calculations attempted elucidate non-equilibrium chemistry effects full expansion direct evidence D 8.20 kms within 1 Fig. 4 Wall velocity PETN 01.766gcc cylinder detonation experiment 39 solid black line simulations solid blue line. The comparison experiments simulations performed equilibrium assumptions good. This suggests gas phase chemical reactions remain sufficiently fast relative expansion rates sizable volume ratios t10 corresponds example VV0 10 reasonable gas phase chemistry freeze-out temperatures likely relatively low. Gas phase nonequilibrium chemistry effects probably due primarily slowdown CO oxidation evidenced example overabundance detonation calorimeter experiments reasonable freeze-out temperatures appear around 1500K. It also worth noting detonation velocity concentrated solution predicted good accuracy chemical equilibrium calculations 25 even though C-J temperature lower 1600K. When taken together results suggest chemistry experimentally measured energy delivered CHNO explosive unlikely due gas nonequilibrium physicochemical effects related condensed carbon production probably play temperatures much higher major role. Such effects involve condensed carbon alone e.g. diamond-graphite phase transformation carbon clusters aggregation well chemical reactions carbon phase gas products. Since chemical reactions occur surface carbon particles likely hinder establishment chemical equilibrium gas phase reactions similar effects known example dominate behavior Al organic The amount condensed carbon produced explosive upon detonation function oxygen balance energy content conditions.

When shock wave passes energetic material detonation wave form. One potential cause transition detonation formation local regions high temperature hot-spots within explosive due presence micron-scale voids. As shock wave passes material voids collapse resulting local increase temperature potentially localized ignition. These regions local ignition combine form detonation wave eventually overtakes original shock. As realistic models formation hot-spots pivotal performing predictive numerical simulations shock-to-detonation transition. Fully resolving hot-spots numerically computationally prohibitive mesh resolution required several orders magnitude smaller required macroscale even mesoscale simulations. Instead present subgrid hot-spot model derived numerical simulations void collapse hot-spot formation. The model provides energy release source dependent strength shock initial size void. The model also provides information time required hot-spot activation induction time nal void size ignition. The model implemented mesoscale simulation code RocSDT3D used demonstrate shock-to-detonation transition realistic mesoscale HMX crystal pack generated packing code Rocpack.

Physics-based Pore Collapse Model In Borne experiments2 wave transient time across cylindrical sample diameter 42 mm length 50 mm approximately 8 Ps. This time corresponds case shock transitioned detonation wave. Thus dynamics associated hot-spot formation ignition must timescale much shorter 8 Ps. Additionally Menikoff3 states For strong shock P 10 GPa note approximately 200 ns. Hot-spots must react fast timescale say within 20 In addition Menikoff showed numerically plastic work viscous heating necessary dissipative mechanisms peak temperatures generated void collapse reach beyond 1000 K critical temperature needed initiation i.e. shock dissipation alone sufficient initiation chemical reaction take place.

Description HERMES model We developed HERMES model High Explosive Response MEchanical Stimulus describe deformation ignition post-ignition pressure build-up occur explosive assemblies subjected impacts. We used model describe HEVR High Explosive Violent Response occur Steven spigot intrusion tests. In tests mechanical insult strong enough induce prompt detonation. Instead threshold velocity depends explosive properties test geometry ignition followed pressure build-up. The confinement ruptured shattered. A substantial fraction original explosive mass left unreacted.13 We also applied HERMES test geometries designed study transition deflagration detonation14. These tests start deliberate localized ignition one end column porous permeable explosive surrounded mechanical confinement. In cases pressure build-up ignition lead detonation starts partway column distance ignition region. In cases result like HEVR confinement rupture unreacted explosive remaining. HERMES multi-species single-velocity description reacting explosive. It embedded Livermore Softwares LS-DYNA15 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratorys ALE3D16 computer simulation programs userdefined material UMAT. To permit use within ALE framework model also incorporates post-advection routine. This routine initializes internal history variables advection transports HERMES material new domain multi-processor simulations readjusts stress deviator tensor yield surface enforces pressure equilibrium ensures consistency partition energy among species. The three species HERMES model explosive product gas unreacted isolated solid particles skeleton matrix solid supports shear stress resists compaction.

Instead energy partition determined method described by1718 illustrated by19. The energy plastic work compaction adiabatic compression given solid remainder given gas.

The two stresses proportional area fraction solid. Throughout model assumed volume area fractions species equal. The equation state gas table calculated Cheetah LLNLs thermo-chemical equilibrium code.20 The solid equation state reference state taken adiabat room temperature pressure. The matrix pressure specified crush pressure Herrmanns P- form910 uses solid equation state high-pressure. The matrix resistance crush shear depends matrix stress total stress. This similar effective stress used soil mechanics water-saturated soils. The shear strength solid borne matrix. If expansion exceeds specified maximum value matrix pressure shear strength zero. The mixture considered gas pressure equilibrium non-interacting particles unreacted explosive. The shear strength depends pressure porosity strain strain-rate using formulation developed calculating resistance concrete high-velocity impact21. The strain-rate strain hardening porosity damage softening fitted uniaxial stress tests using quasi-static loading dynamic loading Split Hopkinson Pressure Bars. The pressure dependence fitted quasi-static triaxial stress tests. The model fit data illustrated in13. In general test data combination high rate loading confining stress although model provides values case. The yield stress Y given subscripts r refer intact residual strength plastic strain porosity. The function R strain-rate dependence T confining stress dependence H strain hardening D damage strain softening. Here Y0 b parameters. By introducing pressure-dependent plastic potential porosity increases plastic shear strain. We Ignition Burning found generally applicable theory evaluate shear stress dependence wide range initial porosity. As result must rely data near porosity interest. In general data best sparse functions porosity frequently available all. We present results simulations indicate sensitivity explosive response unmeasured parameters. In HERMES ignition may either set pre-determined location would case DDT-specific test geometries developed result shear localization. In phenomenological model ignition mechanical insult assume temperature chemical basis onset reaction localized shear strains localized. We wish resolve temperature gradient calculate reaction chemistry length scale. Although account initial temperature response equivalence temperature increase strain-rate decrease typically 10 K per decade permit thermal softening deformation. In way friction explosive confinement tends localize shear strain strain-rate pressure dependencies shear strength result calculated boundary layer containing shear strain typical thickness 0.5 mm. This results resolution requirements similar needed reactive flow calculations detonation. If instead sought resolve shear bands order calculate chemical reaction rates mesh requirements would sub-micron. Following ignition hot product gas diffuse surrounding damaged explosive ignite damaged surfaces. Tests LLNL high-pressure strand burner porous permeable powder thermally damaged explosives shown ignition front advance speeds 103 105 mms. The sound speed flame products calculated times 105 mms. In contrast laminar burn speed flame moving undamaged explosive 102 mms linearly pressure dependent. If particles small large surface area permits mass-burning rate keep pace ignition front little time lag arrival front complete burn behind front. If particles large however significant lag. HERMES calculates surface area fragments function local plastic strain13. In effect comminution model plastic work done explosive used create surface area. Our empirical model calibrated shotgun tests small cylinders explosive fired steel plate low enough velocity explosive ignite. The fragments collected. The surface area given velocity calculated comparing mass-burning rate fragments measured laminar burn speed. Computer simulations impacts used correlate plastic strain observed surface area. At present HERMES uses oversimplification single constant velocity ignition front otherwise account diffusion gas away sites established burning. In ALE3D burn front calculated level set method. In LS DYNA arrival time burn front recalculated element line sight distance new elements satisfy ignition criterion. For DDTspecific tests initial conditions uniform porosity permeability. For case use single velocity value seems adequate. In situations explosive damaged uniformly use single velocity accurate. This type ignition front penetrate undamaged explosive. It custom cases use ignition front velocity appropriate damaged material. Although choice starts burn undamaged regions far early resulting mass burn rate small undamaged region small zero specific surface area. Simultaneously mass-burning rate calculated subsonic burn damaged explosive described employ subset Computational Reaction Evolution dependent entropy S Time model CREST22. In CREST reaction rate dependent function entropy density. In way CREST model intrinsically distinguish burning rate associated slow isentropic pressure rise burning rate associated shock peak pressure. In original developments CREST explosive treated strengthless. Porous explosive exhibited resistance compaction snowplow model. In implementation irreversible work done compaction shear. Refitting CREST parameters match results Shock Detonation Transition SDT experiments compensate calculation plastic work compaction shocks. The plastic work done slow compaction slow shear however enhance reaction rates unintended way. While investigating effects implemented user-option incorporate plastic work calculation reaction rates. We yet resolved treat contribution entropy irreversible deformation associated shock. The CREST parameters shown accurate densities 90 theoretical maximum density TMD nominal 97-98 plastic bonded explosives23. However found inadequate 85 TMD14 lower24. At present uncertain whether inadequacy application granular explosives rather PBX. Our fits CREST parameters limited data available SDT porous explosives unique. It remains possible single parameter set informed multiple gauge records could accurate. We Variations DDT test geometry There several variants test apparatus DDT assessment including ignition method confinement data taken assess DDT size. For tests ignition system DDT shock driven moving piston25. In view akin SDT DDT. For ignition methods without piston ignition system either gas producing not. Gasproducing ignitions26 result more-or-less rapid pressure rise. In RARDE tube test27 results damage full density explosive sample. Hot gas igniter may stream broken explosive also around periphery explosive igniting broken material28. A violent response test result combination explosive frangibility much surface area made laminar burn speed resulting mass burn rate. Other tests use thermite reaction create high temperature without substantial amounts gas29. In principle ignition system presents fewer uncertainties initial condition. Confinement DDT test frequently steel tube steel end caps. In cases transparent tubes used facilitate visual observation gas products andor light output. These generally expense confinement. Reducing confinement pushes transition detonation farther away ignition site. In extreme case transition occur perhaps noticeable change reaction violence vicinity far end cap observed. In simulations observe limited range halving wall thickness results transition location similar one occurs wall thickness half strength. Various methods used assess location DDT transition. Simplest implement gather resulting fragments steel confinement noting location transition sudden change number fragments per unit length tube characteristic appearance steel fragments subjected grazing detonations rather modest pressure rise. Alternatively recording light output streak camera looking either transparent tube transparent window steel confinement show intersection light intensity progressing detonation speed appropriate initial porosity HE start-up region near igniter progress much slower. Strain gauges break wires spaced intervals along tube used record arrival wave progressing detonation speed slower start-up. There systematic offset caused response thick walled tube calculated accounted final interpretation data. Time arrival pins piezoelectric pins mounted confinement tube wall regular intervals also used infer transition location. The confinement tube inner diameter also play role. The DDT tube generally filled Simulations DDT test powder broken HE uniform porosity. If fragment size large fraction inner diameter tube HEwall interactions likely play significant role. At least condition introduces radial distribution porosity introduce radial distribution response. As result transition inferred data collected near wall may representative bulk response. We chose one DDT test variants30 baseline. The confinement tube mild steel used properties 1018 alloy steel 25 mm inside diameter 25 mm wall thickness 340 mm long. The tube held 12 mm thick steel end caps experiment bolted. In simulations record radial stress wall elements adjacent explosive 10 mm axial intervals. Numerical derivative arrival time gives local propagation velocity. We record detonation transition point axial location propagation speed reaches 95 steady detonation velocity initial porosity. Our axisymmetric simulations used thin steel outer tube represent restraint four bolts although simulations bolts pre-stressed. For experiments igniter essentially gasless thermite system. The tube instrumented three pairs strain gauges principal diagnostic appearance tube fragments.

With confinement double nominal size eight times mass run detonation nearly 148 mm. When confinement half nominal size 18 mass response clearly influenced end tube. If apparatus bit smaller still result would explosion transition detonation would occur. Table 1.

When simultaneously changed laminar burn speed linear pressure dependence half value calculated run distance We found single set CREST parameters fit full density reduced density Pop plots. Instead needed treat materials different initial porosity different material. As result cannot reproduce U-shaped response detonation transition distance function porosity data available us. We summarize results presented in14 observing reduced SDT sensitivity reduced confinement strength increased particle size reduced explosive strength increased ignition front velocity serve increase transition location distance ignition plane. The amount increase however depends mass burning rate. Large particles slow mass burning rates generally exhibit sensitivity parameter values. Simulations response large charges We investigated hypothetical large cylindrical charge geometry using baseline material LX04 molding powder beads pressed 15 porosity. The baseline charge 45 kg 300 mm diameter 400 mm long. We assumed ignition volume hemisphere 15 mm diameter located flat surface cylinder. By avoiding ignition location high symmetry avoid convergence effects affect response significantly. Converging pressure locally speed reaction source shock leading detonation. Converging tension tear charge apart reaction complete. In addition chose locate ignition surface. For mechanical ignition plausible location. Insults outside charge strongest point impact. Thermal ignitions likely outside. For large charges heating rates external sources always fast relative thermal transport time. The characteristic time r radius thermal diffusivity. For baseline charge full density HMX would time greater day so. With porosity characteristic thermal time would even longer. Heating rates significantly faster result thermal ignitions near For baseline charge ignition transitioned detonation approximate time 500 s. When downsized charge 5 kg 300 mm diameter 400 mm long explosive billet exploded detonate. This charge close detonation. When moved ignition volume axis three-dimensional calculation coarser mesh achieved detonation pressure reaching opposite corner charge. In case extra run distance reaching free surface enough achieve detonation pressure. The dimension transition detonation occurs depends particle size equivalently laminar burn speed. The smaller charge particle size distribution R value median diameter half nominal transitioned detonation half charge consumed. We conclude typical DDT test apparatus demark given explosive configuration transition detonation apply charge geometries specifically unconfined large charges requires model. We conclude model correct rather may used guide designing next set experiments. Summary equations solved HERMES A recent report33 summarizes equations solved current version HERMES.

This study addresses stability sonic points origin internal shocks double-front detonations using Ficketts detonation analogue. Detonations multiple disparate reactions losses shown permit multiple quasi-steady detonation velocities. Detonations velocities equal investigated numerically. Simulations initiated predicted steady-states solutions prove unstable generating internal shock waves. Only sonic points characteristics diverging either side found stable.

Unsteady simulations initiated predicted steady integral curves understand discrepancy however none steady proles proved stable nished single CJ point point B similar case D DB gure 1 instead two predicted CJ points. The formation internal shocks created always occurred sonic point indicating sonic points may unstable. The four different sonic point possibilities labelled method congruent used name steady-state solutions sonic points lying two weak solutions e.g. point B WWS-initiated simulations gure 3a called sonic point type WW. Likewise sonic point two strong solutions type SS sonic point strong upstream solution weak downstream solution type WS weak upstream strong downstream solution type SW. The top frames gure 7 serve illustrations. All simulations initiated steady integral curves resulted creation internal shocks exception WSS initial curve. Additionally sonic point B always source shocks. As point A quickly became over-driven type SS remained stable shocked type WS. It appears sonic points type WS always remained stable shocked others unstable. The method characteristics used near two sonic points assess stability. Consider ow vicinity sonic point steady state illustrated gure 7. The top frames consist ow property interpreted local velocity speed sound Fick etts analogy. The middle frame shows corresponding instantaneous characteristics information paths. The bottom frame shows resulting ow property period time. The limiting characteristic vertical line middle frame travels along sonic point speed detonation front. For strong solution D information rear left able reach limiting characteristic information right travels faster front hence subsonic respect detonation characteristics right travelling. For weak solution D information cannot keep front therefore carried towards left detonation frame away limiting characteristic supersonic. The characteristics slope depends For sonic point type WW gure 7a characteristic diagram shows perturbations downstream sonic point dissipated rear information speed increases direction. On upstream side perturbations accumulate eventually disturb sonic point. If perturbation immediately upstream sonic point forces ow property become larger D i.e. adopt strong solution ahead sonic point shock wave must formed link weak upstream solution new strong solution ahead sonic point. Flow immediately upstream sonic point satises strong solution maintaining weak solution downstream sonic point. The sonic point type WW created upstream shock transitioned sonic type WS seen bottom Likewise sonic point type SS gure 7b upstream perturbations dissipated downstream accumulate. If perturbation causes D downstream shock created join new weak solution immediately downstream sonic point strong solution rear. A sonic point type WS exists connecting strong upstream solution new weak solution behind sonic point. Sonic points type SW shown gure 7c also unstable. Perturbations accumulate either side. An upstream perturbation acts way type WW sonic point downstream Type WW sonic point gives rise upstream b Type SS sonic point gives rise downstream c Type SW sonic point gives rise shocks either side Type WS sonic point remains stable Fig. 7 Illustration ow vicinity sonic point initial ow property top initial instantaneous characteristics middle resulting ow property bottom perturbation manner type SS sonic point. Two shocks created one upstream downstream sonic point transforms type WS sonic point. Finally type WS sonic point gure 7d characteristic diagram shows perturbations either side limiting characteristic dissipated away sonic point explaining stability seen simulations. From analysis expected sonic points type WS characteristic paths diverge either side stable. The rest transform create shocks stable sonic point type WS. This leads consequence order two sonic points coexist must separated shock wave. In simulations internal shocks sonic points eventually reached sonic point A accelerated detonation front. This instability ascribed feature model whereby position internal shock placed two sonic points possible. The detonation locity also found slightly under-driven D DAB point A sonic slightly over-driven after. The lack sonic condition point A end simulations caused detonation over-drive. This could due numerical diffusion effects needs investigated. Otherwise expected type SS sonic point A would cast internal shock backwards two sonic points would In under-driven piston-initiated hybrid detonations allow two coexisting steady sonic points sonic point B matching generalized CJ criterion appear detonation achieves steady velocity D DA DAB dictated rst sonic point. The second sonic point necessarily unstable type WW. Unsteady solutions double sonic point congurations initiated under-driven conditions DDeventually changes intoDDeventually changes intoDDeventually changes intoDDeventually changes intoDwith predicted steady-state solutions proved unstable. Internal shock waves generated two sonic planes third shock located behind second sonic plane formed rear boundary conditions supported it. Only sonic points diverging characteristics found stable. An internal shock therefore required two stable sonic points coexist detonation. This claries roots double front detonations seen previous work. Internal shocks formed eventually overtook rst sonic plane joined accelerated detonation front. The model features ability accommodate shocks anywhere behind sonic points. In simulations resulted moving internal shocks gave rise viscous-like structures point A. It expected shock would maintained sonic points case. The results illustrate solutions multiple solutions may unstable11 12. Additional investigation required expanding model allow non-numerical viscous effects example. 3. Radulescu M. Tang J. Zhang F.

Rapid acceleration spherical shell liquid following detonation high explosive causes liquid form fine jets similar appearance particle jets formed explosive dispersal packed layer solid particles. Of particular interest determining dependence scale jet-like structures physical parameters system including fluid properties e.g. density viscosity surface tension ratio mass liquid explosive. The present paper presents computational results multimaterial hydrocode describing dynamics explosive dispersal process. The computations used track overall features dispersal liquid layer including wave dynamics motion spall accretion layers.

The results show number jet structures sensitive fluid properties primarily dependent mass ratio. Above certain mass ratio liquid fill explosive burster FB number jets approximately constant consistent empirical model based maximum thickness accretion layer. For small values FB number liquid jets reduced contrast explosive powder dispersal small FB yields larger number particle jets. Detonation central high explosive charge surrounded shell material common practical geometry many application areas physics interaction detonation surrounding material continues studied. These areas include blast mitigation fuel-air explosions metalized explosives reactive casings. In paper consider shell liquid surrounding explosive charge spherical geometry. The behaviour following detonation high explosive charge underwater studied detail many years see example Cole1.

In case outer liquid surface longer stable forms jet-like structures suggesting strongly wave interactions outer boundary play key role observed break-up process. Milne et al.34 noted dispersal experimental evidence wide range expanding cloud explosively disseminated material comprised particles fragments significantly different dimensions associated original material. Photographic evidence shows expanding fragments. Examples formation jet structures given example liquid particle outer boundary reaches Frost et al.5 Ripley Zhang6 Frost Zhang7 context jet formation heterogeneous blast explosives.

They showed number fragments observed early time radiographs late time photographic evidence good agreement. A simple model predict number jets powders proposed. Explosive acceleration liquid shell differs corresponding situation solid particles due presence voids unperturbed particle bed. In latter case shock propagating particles causes considerable compaction depending ductility particles compacted bed may considerable strength compaction. In case shock loading liquid reflection expansion wave liquid surface subsequent tension applied bulk liquid lead cavitation formation void growth subsequent breakup bubbly liquid Explosive dispersal liquid progresses several regimes. In first regime termed ejection regime9 forces associated propagation shock wave liquid rarefaction returns liquid surface dominate motion fluid. This followed transition regime aerodynamic forces liquid. In final regime shock forces decayed aerodynamic drag droplet breakup due competition inertial surface The present work concerned nearfield ejection regime occurs timescale 100s microseconds shock forces dominate. Of particular interest determining dependence scale jet-like structures fluid properties e.g. density viscosity surface tension ratio mass physical parameters liquid explosive. The number liquid jets formed rate droplet shedding subsequent evaporation liquid determine size liquid-vapour-air cloud ultimately formed interest liquid combustible. In present paper dynamics explosive dispersal process investigated multimaterial hydrocode. The computations used track features process including wave dynamics motion spall accretion layers. A working hypothesis dynamic liquid breakup proposed maximum thickness accretion hypothesis examined light experimental results spherical charges containing variety different fluids determine influence fluid properties. Water chosen baseline fluid liquids chosen significant variations fluid properties including glycerol similar density surface tension water much higher viscosity vegetable oil similar density water higher viscosity tension ethanol similar density viscosity water lower surface experimental computational results existing theoretical models describing fragmentation liquids first considered. Theoretical Models Liquid Breakup The dynamic breakup liquids considered theoretically Grady10. He found energy-limited spall liquids dominated surface energy effects low strain rates viscous dissipation high rates. He also noted exists relatively little experimental information liquid spall. His model used estimate order magnitude liquid fragment jet size. Let us compare results Grady model determine estimates fragment size thus number. The Grady model predicts fragment values two limits namely surface tension dominated viscous dissipation dominated. Which mechanism dominant determined spall strength. As surface tension viscosity act stabilize break-up argument presentation dominant mechanism situation one largest spall strength. Effect Surface Tension Grady model predicts fragment size For surface tension dominated problems surface tension density H local strain rate. Effect Viscosity model gives fragment size For viscous dominated problems Grady viscosity. The implications theoretical model predictions considered comparing breakup liquids large difference viscosity i.e. water glycerol next Experimental Results Experiments carried three different sized spherical glass casings volumes 2.8 1.0 0.4 L respectively. The largest casing thick-walled 3 mm thick glass sphere whereas smaller two charges consisted thin-walled 1 mm thick glass spheres prepared removing filaments commercial globe-style incandescent light bulbs. A photograph 1 L sphere shown Fig. 2 also shows central explosive burster consisting C4 within hollow plastic sphere 3 mm wall thickness. A tube attached burster sphere used allow insertion detonator C4. Two different sized burster charges used either 5.1 3.8 cm outer dia containing either 80 28 g C4 respectively. Fig. 2.

The images shown Fig. 3 80 g C4 explosive surrounded 2.8 L liquid contained glass sphere. The water density 0.998 kgm3 glycerol density 1.126 kgm3. This gives fill-to-burster mass ratios FB 34.5 40.9 respectively. In later sections shall report results varying ratio fill liquid. Fig. 3.

We find counting jets directly image subjective. Intensity levels strongly influence interpretation. We prefer scan image obtain line plots intensity count features these. Since jet structures much wider scan line take care choosing representative scans. We know arbitrary radial line miss structures choose lines show largest number radial features analyze. This method still degree subjectivity find consistent method. A comparison results using different techniques counting jets given earlier publication4. Using method gives typical comparison intensity vs. pixel number shown Fig. 4. Comparisons scans intensity vs. radius images Fig. 3. This analysis suggests roughly number structures scan. There similar high frequency details signals higher intensity no. bits glycerol data makes distinct. One thus conclude data number jets comparable two liquids 11 14 radial features 12 2-1 water data 10 13 radial features 11 2-1 glycerol data. These numbers imply primary fragment sizes order 7 mm diameter. Comparison Grady Model We return predictions Grady model light experimental results. For surface tension dominated liquid breakup Eqn 1 gives prediction fragment size. For water typically 0.07 Jm2 1000 kgm3. For glycerol experiments 1126 kgm3 water glycerol similar values surface tension surface energy. In experiments liquid expands around 400 msec typical radius 0.1 m. gives strain rate around 4000 sec-1. For values model suggests 0.6 mm. This size droplet typical size seen spray dome associated underwater explosions explosively driven water experiments significantly smaller dimensions implied current analysis class experiments see much larger primary fragments roughly order magnitude At high strain rates viscous terms dominate spall strength making liquid resistant spall. For water 10-3 Pa.s glycerol 1.5 Pa.s. These values give predictions viscous dominated fragment size Eqn. 2 46 water 1.3 mm glycerol. By comparing spall strengths implied Grady theory viscous surface tension dominated break-up might expect pure water surface tension dominated breakup pure glycerol viscous dominated breakup. These models thus suggest water fragments 0.6 mm glycerol fragments 1.3 mm much smaller observed. If step back consider trends implied Grady model comparing surface tension dominated value water viscous dominated value glycerol suggests glycerol fragments roughly twice size water fragments thus approximately 8 times water jets glycerol jets 4 times many features along radial scan water. This odds observations showed similar number The Grady order magnitude analysis suggests surface tension alone difference number jets experiment since water glycerol mixtures two almost identical surface tension values. This consistent trends observed numbers jets much less theory If viscosity alone dominates since room temperature glycerol viscosity 1500 times higher water expect 1500 40 times larger particles 40 times fewer jets. This observed experiments. The evidence thus viscosity dominant effect. The arguments led us consider series experiments using different liquids different sizes container range FB Our experimental series considers different sizes container different charge sizes. If tension viscosity major influences fragmentation might expect hydrodynamic scaling obtain number fragments different sizes sphere. In Fig. 5 compare results two experiments. Fig. 5. Intensity versus radial distance two water experiments different scales 0.94 kg 2.8 kg similar values FB. One see similar numbers features experiments numerical experimental analysis use FB independent variable. Fig. 6 shows typical scans images different liquids. We use radius-time plots type illustrated Fig. 7 identify thickness compressed layer release wave reaches inner surface mean shell radius r time. If assume primary breakup phase occurs time assume simplicity fragments cubes number fragments predicted Since chosen use number features along radial scan n experimental measure useful record measure relates number fragments predicted. By assuming constant solid angle feature work consider observables vary fill burster mass ratio In order illustrate expected behaviour let us consider limit thin shells purely mathematical simplicity since many experiments becomes poor approximation.

We use preferred method counting feature along radial scan quantify Fig. 9. Measured number features error bars along radial line glass bead dispersion various ratios FB. For liquids slightly complex wave structure1. As Figure 7 shows liquids exhibit spall layer low density cavitation region forms inward propagating release wave. At time release wave Fig. 10. Calculated liquid density vs. time radius water surrounding C4 explosive illustrate wave interface behaviour If argued eliminating surface tension viscosity difference water glycerol density. As extreme consider changing density numerical model. Using universal liquid Hugoniot11 allows us model different liquids easily self-consistently. We assume minimum pressure zero model lack support tension liquid. We systematically investigate effects varying density sound speed using geometries remainder paper. Since experimental data shows number features seen different scales FB ratio remains constant choose model range FB values material types. We use universal liquid Hugoniot equation state. This requires reference density sound speed provided. Table 1.

As baseline problem consider charge radius 0.5 mm vary outer radius fill 1 mm 2.5 mm. The table illustrates range values FB resulting Table 2. Geometries used resulting FB ratios We plot resulting radius time plots use data identify maximum thickness accretion layer mean shell radius r time. If assume primary breakup phase occurs time assume simplicity fragments cubes number fragments predicted given Eqn. 4 number features along radial scan given Eqn. 5 above. Let us compare results modelling described experimental results water-filled experiments. Fig. 10 shows number features along radial scan predicted modelling using hypothesis primary fragment dimension equal maximum thickness accretion layer. As increase FB model predicts number features along scan thus total number jets decrease. This trend seen model experiment In figure also plot result analysis experimental data error bar estimates.

Predicted measured number features along radial line glycerol For large FB experiment suggests flat line liquids FB greater 15 number jets independent liquid FB. The model predictions similar number high FB show pronounced decrease features FB increases whole range. All liquids show opposite trend number jets decrease FB decreases lower end. We also show representative result wider work powders. Here glass bead data shows shape decreasing FB. At high FB see fewer features powders liquids. This common observation one original Fig. 14. Predicted measured number features along radial line materials considered paper function FB. If consider liquid data isolation see data range liquids differing surface tension viscosities densities seem lie common curve. This suggests properties dominant determining primary fragment size. We must continue look alternative hypotheses. We reported experimental study aimed addressing mechanisms determine number jets seen explosive dissemination liquids. When outer boundary e.g. underwater explosion depth observe extremely stable gas bubble jetting. We clearly longer stable expansion system introduce outer boundary suggesting strongly wave interactions outer boundary play key role observed break-up process. We thus seek investigate detail causes observed jetting. We began considering theoretical models breakup bulk liquids due Grady. His early work noted lack experimental data test provided one motivation work. The independent variables models density viscosity surface tension well strain rate amenable variation liquids. Our results show fragment sizes match model predictions. We previously dissemination powders independent variables Grady models harder prescribe experimentally found good empirical correlations primary fragment size thus number jets predicted shell thickness. The shell structure liquids complex due presence spall layer considered amended empirical model maximum thickness spall layer measure. This measure predicts jets liquids powders observed gives reasonable estimates number jets high 15 values FB. The underlying shape curve n vs. FB match experiments unlike case powders shows fewer If plot data chosen range liquids one plot see common curve. This suggests properties dominant determining primary fragment size.

Explosive dispersal granular materials liquids displays multiple scales jetting structures smaller perturbations often superimposed larger structures. Perturbations may originate near boundaries booster shock-dispersed media outer edge charge interfaces often feature thin casing material fragments influences instabilities. The present work includes situation particles saturated liquid explosive numerically investigate jetting instability observed premixed particles-explosive configuration. Previous experimental observations thermobaric explosives demonstrated well-defined jetting structures. Macroscopic multiphase flow simulation shows densification jetting particles. Numerical results consistent experimental observations understanding origin mechanism controlling formation jetting structures number jetting instabilities. The likelihood difference jetting instability premixed configuration stratified particles-explosive configuration discussed. The formation post-detonation particle jets widely observed many problems associated explosive dispersal granular materials liquids.12345 Perturbations shown form early persistent jet structures apparent later times. Analysis small-scale nominal 2 litre experimental results liquids powders hybrid mixtures cylindrical dispersal configuration indicated correlation number jets initial particle expansion velocity Gurney velocity casing mass replaced mass dispersed media.356 A macroscopic particle attraction model suggested demonstrate early-time fracturing powder bed subsequent particle structures.6 The fracture spacing within shock timescale ultimately determines primary jets. Explosive Dispersal Liquids Particle jets liquid dispersal may originate near boundaries central booster shock-dispersed media outer edge instabilities. The fact particle jets also form absence outer casing experiments7 landmine shallow underwater explosion indicates interior instability interfaces often entail critical condition. Small-scale experiments however difficult distinguishing instability phenomena associated origins. A recent large-scale experiment45 involving 7100 litre liquid dispersal central cylindrical explosive booster i.e. stratified configuration shown dual jetting structure outer boundary introduces minor surface instabilities leading micro-jets edge overtaken major jet structures later time. The number major jets traced back nearsurface liquid radial fractures occur within timescale. Modeling results showed major jetting structure triggered inner booster casing instability.458 In case number major jets dictated fragment number inner casing however interior perturbation length scale may generalized hydrodynamic Richtmyer-Meshkov detonation shock entering dispersed media. The RMI becomes considerably complex multiphase flow. Explosive Dispersal Stratified Powders Explosive dispersal stratified powders hybrid mixtures also featured dual jet structures observed experiments.3 Xu et al.9 demonstrated using mesoscale simulations number major particle clustersjets dictated initial particle number inner layer explosive interface. In attempt link finding macroscopic real world innerlayer particles interpreted particle agglomerates fragments casing explosive packed particle bed similar observed liquid dispersal. The particle flow additional complexity collision compaction agglomeration may refine length scale major jetting.

Casing effects included using conservative closely-coupled method employing explicit finite element solution LS-DYNA. A sequence progressive meshes used described elsewhere.58 The first mesh resolution 0.2 mm therefore detonation zone modeled detail. The outside charge diameter cases 100 mm. In model particle momentum controlled enhanced drag force due high-volume 1109 fraction particle flow represented piecewise drag law12 without directly modeling particle-particle interactions including collision compaction deformation Interior Instability The inner surface focus previous modeling studies458 explain dual jetting structure central booster used dispersal payload remained inert. In present work detonation thermobaric explosive payload boosted central high explosive core. It therefore unclear whether detonation payload change interior instability booster interface perturbations. An oversized 20-mm-diameter booster considered examine problem. A mixture aluminum particles saturated sensitized liquid nitromethane forms TBX charge. A particle size distribution 20 10 employed. Aluminum particles treated inert order focus particle jetting dynamics. The mass loading 63.6 aluminum 36.4 NM. A steel casing 0.8 mm thick separates booster TBX mixture. Following previous works458 inner casing pre-fragmented equal-sized fragments. The central booster TNT initiated central axis. Detonation TNT booster drives inner casing turn initiates NM. The bulk detonation propagates radially outward 5.3 mms mean flow pressure 6.9 GPa travelling deficit relative neat explosive due particles. Pressure fluctuations noticeable due randomness size placement consequently local concentration field. Figure 3 illustrates interior process. The detonation propagation shock acceleration particles much faster booster casing fragment dispersal velocity 0.43 mms 5 s. Therefore compaction limited particles TBX although important dispersal stratified dry powder. By 25 inner casing fragments reached maximum dispersal distance driven inwards pressure NM detonation products. At time aluminum particles already begun venting TNT products though case however flow remains stagnated outer edge rarefaction arrives charge centre. The instability may viewed RMI perturbation length scale defined number inner case fragments. Figure 4 shows growth inner instability. After 1 ms particles multiphase RMI accelerated rarefaction.

The outer surface instability certainly source jets particularly minor jets micro-jets. Considering large jet structures Milne2 provided reasonable justification Rayleigh Taylor instability RTI takes long form therefore source particle jetting phenomena. For present TBX configuration outer casing 1.6-mm-thick plastic 1.27 gcc used natural fragmentation based simple failure strain criterion f 0.7. The combustion interface interaction outer container fragments results early time micro-jetting detonation products fractures. The container fragment number initiates outer contact surface instability however later develop gas RTI instead detonation products ultimately entrained particle flow.

Calculations performed remapping onto numerical mesh 40 mm resolution far-field. It noted results Figure 8 mirrored computational efficiency. Real results symmetric circumference rather random. At 20 ms particle dispersal slowed considerably reached nearly static state. Three classes jets identifiable streamer type jet dissipative merged micro-jets denser surface jets. Both inner outer different booster configurations outer surface jets originated minor jets. The streamer jets formed locations highest micro-jetting caused nozzle-shaped fracture openings including aligned vertical boundary. While leading streamer jets quite similar location number due repeatable mesh perturbation denser surface jets quite different. For smaller booster dense jets appear merged groups micro-jets larger cased booster dense jets much distinct fewer number. Counting jet number subjective task accounting number valleys may related bulk fractures. An analysis fragment locations showed location valleys merged minor jets Figure 8 left corresponded position widest container fragments. The coherent denser surface jets traced back widest gaps formed fragments highest driving pressure ratio fracture space. The initial number pattern minor jets controlled outer container breakup. In order connect late-time jets outer container breakup analyzed further. The fragment size distribution LS-DYNA plastic failure stain model shown Figure 9 exhibits normal distribution sizes. For comparison results 3.2-mm-thick casing also given. Assuming symmetry full circumference 10-mm-diameter uncased booster produced 112 outer fragments comparison 124 outer fragments 20-mm-diameter cased booster thin plastic container. Examining Figure 8 considerably less number thin case fragments. This demonstrates minor jets merged dominant surface overtaken minor jets. For larger booster dominant jets late time overtaken 2-3 minor jets Figure 8 right. late-time number persistent Fig. 8. Late-time particle jetting instabilities left 10-mm-diameter uncased booster right 20-mmdiameter booster cased pre-fragmented inner casing. Both natural fragmentation thin outer container. Results mirrored symmetric model. configuration outer casing achieved expansion inert payload driven central booster. In current TBX configuration outer casing expansion fragmentation directly driven massive payload detonation instead small booster. By time TBX detonation shock reaches outer casing wall effects booster size reduced diminished see Figure 10 however flow instability induced booster fragments remains connected outer fragmentation pattern. The smaller booster resulted larger fragments i.e. greater 6 mm wide larger booster. Although outer fragment number similar booster sizes detonation multiphase flow subsequent outer casing fracture location fragment size appear significantly influenced booster instability thus may still affect jetting phenomenon. TBX detonation Fig. 10. Flow pressure measured gauges near container wall. The present work explored fundamental particle jetting phenomena TBX charge instabilities. The numerical model include particle collision agglomeration additional dense flow turbulence effects would serve enhance particle jets. More challenging features Fig. 9. Polyethylene container fragment size distribution quarter-symmetric model. For booster sizes thin outer casing resulting average outer container wall expansion velocity 2.27 mms prior failure. An average fragment width may estimated using empirical average fragment width corresponds 137 fragments around full circumference. Figure 9 predicted fragments larger average 3.2 mm 10-mm-diameter booster 2.8 mm 20-mm-diameter booster. Similarly thick plastic casing resulting smaller wall velocity empirical fragment width 2.7 mm compared average 3.9 mm determined numerically. The deformation natural distribution sizes triggered randomness mesh precision stochastic pressure fluctuations multiphase detonation. Since thin-wall circumferential strain rate nearly boosters appears interior instability breakup outer casing. 20-mm-dimeter booster affected micro-jets mainly controlled outer container fragmentation. In detonation stage dynamic stress bridging shock sintering particle damage particle fragmentation may enhance internal instability mechanism. Thus present results using simple calculation approaches provide qualitative information tackling real systems three-dimensions reserved future work. Latetime aerodynamic particle-particle interaction may improve coherency already formed jet structures responsible jet formation number. Micro-jetting container fragmentation produced strong outer surface resulting persistent jets merged minor jets fragmentation internal booster casing would still enhance minor jets. The inner booster size may change outer casing fragmentation leading different minor jets. In addition number particle jets obtained TBX charge simulations consistent experiments different shape conical jets produced stratified dispersal.

With level detail able successfully model thermal mechanical response HMX based explosives undergoing thermal build explosion. However liquid explosives melt early heat phase much complicated require different treatment material motion effects. The explosive longer treated using implicit mechanical assumption must make assumptions define flow material. This flow changes way energy composition moved around system characteristics moved material convective manner well original diffusive processes. In paper describe changes made ALE3D5 model fluid melting explosives. The overall goal modeling effort predict violence explosive reaction. This means one needs able continuously model explosive initial relatively quiescent pre-ignition phase much violent post-ignition phase. Doing requires physical processes need modeled phases calculation though necessarily set approximations. Much solid explosives model system using implicit mechanics scheme transition explicit mechanics scheme handle final reaction phase look construct model couples slow mechanical fluid processes pre-ignition phase transitions explicit final phase.

To necessary two types models running simultaneously incompressible flow model fluid explosive implicit hydrodynamics model solid components system.

This allows user define multiple discontinuous regions problem space material parameters average pressure. Then pressure computed node based current composition temperature reference density. This pressure volume averaged connected areas problem compute average pressure. This average pressure combined flow pressure define pressure boundary condition hydrodynamics step.

Whitworth AWE Aldermaston Reading Berkshire RG 7 4PR UK Abstract. Performed Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Jack Rabbit designed study detonation response TATB-based explosive LX-17. In paper entropy-dependent CREST reactive burn model applied Jack Rabbit data see well otherwise predict response LX-17 explosive. Within number experimental modeling uncertainties CREST able simulate observed shock desensitization detonation wave corner turning behaviour four five experiments. The experimental free-surface velocity measurements modeled without recourse additional desensitization criteria used pressuredependent reactive burn models. Two important phenomena pertinent detonation performance triaminotrinitrobenzene TATB-based explosives detonation wave corner turning shock desensitization. Although studied individually practical applications processes could present concurrently. To address Hart1 conducted interesting series experiments called Jack Rabbit designed study detonation wave corner turning shock desensitization explosive LX-17 92.5 TATB 7.5 Kel-F. Corner turning refers relative inability detonation wave overcome divergence flow caused sudden change propagation direction. TATB-based explosives exhibit relatively long detonation reaction zone lengths 2-3mm.2 As result propagating detonation waves weaken markedly attempting turn sharp corners. This lead sustained non-reacted andor partially reacted pockets explosive dead-zones behind corner turn region.3-6 The first objective Jack Rabbit test ability LX-17 detonation waves propagate around two 90 corners embedded steel plate. The term shock desensitization describes reduced response explosives complex shock loading e.g. shock reflections sequential shocks detonation extinction. Data latter scarce. Campbell Travis7 Dick8 observed detonation waves PBX 9404 94 HMX 3 NC 3 CEF PBX 9502 95 extinguished upon propagating pre-shocked explosive. For Jack Rabbit hypothesized LX-17 detonation waves successfully turned corners embedded plate would run pre-compressed explosive. The second objective Harts experiments see detonation extinction would occur LX-17. Jack Rabbit provided wealth data validating reactive burn models. Many use pressure-dependent reaction rates require additional modifications model complex shock phenomena. CREST9 based analysis inmaterial gauge data10 concluded first order reaction rate dependent shock strength. CREST depicts shock strength using function entropy non-reacted explosive.11 No additional modifications made model shock desensitization. In paper CREST applied Jack Rabbit data see well predict detonation response The Jack Rabbit series112 consisted five ambient temperature experiments labeled 2021E PT3 PT4 PT5 PT6 PT7 see Fig. 1.

The main charge sandwiched two 6mm-thick aluminium plates diameter. To allow detonator cabling assembly LX-17 charge parted along plane running along bottom steel plate. Plastic shims 0.05mm thick placed two LX-17 parts establish uniform gap back-filled APC silastic. The interesting aspect geometry steel plate serves shadowplate protects layer LX-17 initial detonation booster main charge. For explosive layer detonate detonation waves propagate around corners shadowplate LX-17 region above.

This may significant effect activation mechanism -HMX since plastic slip acts shear relaxation mechanism hence less mechanical work available temperature rise leading chemical reaction. For orientations 010100 large shear stress arises steric hindrance may provide much mechanical work increase temperature required initiate chemical decomposition. Further Fig. 6 see 011100 orientation twinslip plane 101101 accommodate large shear strain. In investigation twinslip phase field modeling verify twinslip plane accommodate large shear strain. We observe orientations yield resolved shear stress twinslip plane along twinslip direction predominantly elastic. For elastic orientations large shear stress arises steric may provides much mechanical work increase temperature detonation. The orientations resolved shear stress along twinslip direction exceeds critical resolved shear stress material starts twinslip absorb strain plastic deformation allowing less sensitive less mechanical work available temperature rise. Therefore twinning plastic slip associated greater shear relaxation hence decreased sensitivity. We may conclude deformation twinning essential accurately capture volumetric response -HMX may significant effect activation.

In application thermal-fluids model strong convection mass momentum energy reduced high temperatures associated low slurry viscosities make simulations numerically tractable. The ODTX thermal-fluids simulations show fast experiments flow reduces explosion times self-heated liquid rises top cavity ignites.

Due form equation state necessary write governing ow equations modied form previously derived. The derivation modied equations presented model discussed. Detonations rate sticks non-ideal explosives propagate speeds signicantly lower one-dimensional Chapman-Jouget CJ detonation velocity. This multi-dimensional effects important class explosives due large reaction zone length behind shock. The one-dimensional model based upon assumption reaction zone thickness much smaller charge width diameter effects negligible. For non-ideal explosives ANFO propagation speed found 50 CJ speed1. This suggests ow adequately described one-dimensional theory multi-dimensional effects shock front curvature due nite rate-stick diameter need considered. Initiation detonation produces shock wave rapidly accelerates explosive reaches steady state propagation velocity D. The shock wave supported exothermic chemical reaction initiated shock propagates explosive. Various steady-state detonation models incorporating two-dimensional effects devel oped.

Due mathematical simplicity ease implementation BeckerKistiakowski-Wilson BKW equation state still used thermochemical computer codes predict detonation parameters despite lack rigorous theoretical background. It gives satisfactory agreement calculated experimentally obtained detonation parameters many standard high explosives densities range 1 1.9 gcm3. However beyond density limits agreement generally poor. A number different parameter sets BKW EOS proposed order overcome limitations shortcomings unfortunately limited success. To address problem applied alternative approach includes optimization covolume factors detonation products obtained ab-initio calculations match experimental shock Hugoniot data adjustments BKW coefficients reproduce experimental detonation pressures velocities also detonation parameters introduction new concept densitypressure-dependent covolume factors well modification BKW EOS adding exponent covolume term x. thermochemical equilibrium code EXPLO5 carried calculations series explosives densities ranging 0.25 1.9 gcm3. The calculation shows palpable improvement accuracy lower densities explosives. The overall error predicting detonation pressure velocity studied explosives expressed root mean square percent error RMS 7.26 2.59 respectively. We found accuracy modified BKW EOS close accuracy physically-based EOS. modified BKW EOS Thermochemical codes use thermodynamics solve simultaneously state variables chemical composition detonation products performance1.

As pointed Fried1 term covolume factor somewhat misnomer best treat effective interaction parameter. In high density limits acts effective molecular volume multiplied stiffness factor lower densities related viral coefficients. The present form BKW EOS proposed Cowan Fickett2 1954 since form equation remains unchanged number attempts optimize constants covolumes BKW EOS order parameters. For example Mader10 used two BKW sets parameters BKW-TNT set high carbon explosives BKW-RDX set high oxygen explosives. He used covolumes main detonation products H2O CO2 CO N2 adjusted best reproduce experimental Hugoniot data. Finger et al.11 proposed BKWR set Baer Hobbs12 proposed BKWS parameter set basis large product species calibration. Fried et al.1 employed modern stochastic optimization algorithm parameter set covolumes BKWC set best matched available experimental data. The validity limitation BKW EOS discussed many researchers15121314. They noticed BKW EOS fails reproduce accurately detonation velocities pressures initial densities explosives1214. The validity may also questionable designing new materials products properly calibrated. Table 1.

Thus use set covolumes BKWN set Table 2 Some sets BKW parameters covolumes derived different methods BKW constants covolume BKWC BKWS BKWN Abinitio Legend BKWS set calculated geometrical volume model12 BKWC set obtained stochastic optimization method1 BKWN set obtained matching experimental Hugoniots work Ab-initio set obtained ab-initio From previous works1421 drew following conclusions. Firstly possible adjust BKW constants covolume sets derived different methods reproduce experimental detonation velocities pressures fairly well sets RMS 3-6 D 7-12 p. This suggests detonation velocity rather insensitive function covolume. However different values covolumes give rather different consequently heats detonation. For example lower formic acid covolume used BKWN BKWS sets results formic acid important detonation product HMX RDX PETN higher value e.g. ab-initio set give formic acid detonation products. We found predicted detonation properties PETN RDX HMX high densities sensitive covolume formic acid. Thus slightly modified covolume different parameter sets describe accurately detonation properties Secondly none covolume sets could solve problem overestimated detonation velocities pressures lower initial densities explosives. This illustrated Fig.1 using BKWC BKWS sets standard sets Cheetah 2.01 code BKWN sets standard set EXPLO5 code. For BKWC BKWS sets calculation done taking solid carbon graphite form explosives BKWN set diamond form TNT TATB DATB FOX7 explosives graphite form. Fig. 1. Difference experimental calculated detonation velocities From Figs. 1 2 three sets seem reasonably predict detonation velocities pressures densities 1.2 gcm3. With several exceptions e.g. HNO explosives BKWC BKWN sets CNO explosives BKWS set error mainly within 5 detonation velocities 15 detonation pressures. However lower densities parameter sets largely overestimate detonation velocities pressures. Also clear trend increase error decrease density. Fig. 2. Difference experimental calculated detonation pressures Modification covolume-density dependence The larger deviation calculated p D lower densities explosives time good agreement higher densities suggest dependence covolume term x density accurately described BKW EOS. Recall proposed Becker15 given form x KVg. This relationship gives satisfactory results high densities covolume may related molecular volume repulsive forces dominate. At lower densities attraction molecules starts play important role covolume may related virial coefficients Accurate density- temperature-dependent covolumes required accurately reproduce pressure entire range densities. error becomes The logical conclusion using smaller covolumes lower densities bring values pressure closer experimental values i.e. reproduce accurately p D. We performed adjustment covolumes following steps.

Since imperfection term given Eq.1 one modify Fx value given V T changing value total covolume gas products K. Thus Fx adjusted match true value Fx i.e. match experimental p D. This done trial error method multiplying K so-called Fig. 4.

A small value requires small values reproduce experimental detonation parameters. We found small value e.g. 250 eliminate pressure singularity problem T0 K 0.26 fairly good reproduce detonation temperature.

Furthermore calibration BKW parameters BKWN-EnRI1 set easier BKWCC2 due difficulties describing correctly kf f dependence low density limits. systematically lower detonation pressures 1-4 except BKWS set also gives lower pressure higher densities much higher pressures lower densities average difference slightly positive. The also noticed Fried Souers13 found equilibrium codes predict C-J pressures systematically lower measured. Interestingly Green Lee26 made extensive review refinement earlier measurements C-J pressures PETN LLNL found previously reported values C-J pressures 6 lower.

Blast performance two structural energetic material SEM cases around cylindrical high explosive charges open inside structures presented. Details whole reaction process fully understood yet experimental observations attempts qualitative numerical simulations indicate depending types SEM cases reactions take place two distinct forms fine-particle reaction FPR impact-induced reaction IIR. The major distinction comes sizes fragments coming SEM cases. Numerical simulations helped identify mechanisms limitations types reactions. Structural energetics materials SEMs half-century old concept Ref. 1 seen major interest recently. SEMs advantage used warhead case surrounding high explosive HE additional energy chemical reaction Depending time scale reaction relative blast wave formation high explosive charge additional energy manifested forms blast andor heat. SEMs particularly useful defeat hard targets buildings bunkers underground structures. It minimizes role fragments targets fragments effective also reduces collateral effects unintentional fragments. Improvements blast strength overpressure impulse several hundred percent observed SEMs used small-scale weapon configurations. Stronger energetic SEMs manufactured studied detail. SEMs designed manufactured many different ways. One way manufacture SEMs compact fuel particles mold although case structural strength may high especially particles compacted full theoretical maximum density TMD. Many different types fuel andor inert particles compacted without porosity. Other methods manufacture may include cold-sprayed SEMs The details full reaction process SEMs well understood. However grouped following three general stages 1 heating fuel elements fragmentation 2 fragmentation dispersal mixing ambient air finally 3 ignition combustion air. ingredient particles In first stage initial deformation SEM HE shock heats fragments SEM. There multiple possible heating mechanisms stretching case meso-scale deformations thermitic reactions among deforming ingredients ingredients. After fragmentation anaerobic heating detonation products aerobic heating surrounding shocked air heat fragmented particles. Some processes macroscopic deformations interphase heating estimated numerical simulations. Some others poorly understood. manufacturing techniques tested different test conditions see example Ref. 4-9. Some limited theoretical modeling Ref. 10 numerical simulations Ref. 11-14 attempted. Interesting results obtained studies explored small number SEMs. At present systematic comprehensive understanding predict types SEM materials perform better others given Fine-Particle Reaction FPR Impact-Induced Some observations made reaction behaviors SEMs. Among differentiation reactions fine particles large fragments. For lack names called fine-particle reaction FPR fine particles impact-induced reaction IIR large fragments. Fine particles means less several hundred microns particularly range tens microns. Large fragments means order millimeters larger. The term shock-induced reaction SIR used authors place FPR SIR replaced paper FPR represent broader scope When SEM-cased HE detonates structure SEM case expands. expansion case goes heating ingredients fragmentation small large particles. When cloud particles expands radially mixes ambient air particle number density reduced. The detonation product gasses containing water vapor carbon dioxide infiltrate inside particle bed heat may react fine particles. At time outer layer particle bed comes contact hot shocked air heated may react air. Both immediate reactions fine particles near original HESEM charge location called SIR called FPR 1st kind. Another form FPR FPR 2nd kind may take place particles heated enough heating processes. Nonignition happen particles higher ignition temperatures particles somewhat larger. These particles even larger ones large enough withstand drag forces long slow significantly reaching structure walls. When preceding blast wave hits walls reflected waves higher gas temperatures engulf nearby fine particles ignite them. The subsequent reaction called FPR 2nd kind. The second stage fragmentation process also complex. Some SEMs may generate fragments original ingredient sizes larger fragments formed. Their sizes may depend deformation processes andor manufacturing processes. Often size mechanical combustion material properties larger particles predictable. Particle collection characterization dense fragments tens microns new art data sets available currently. Larger fragments fly ahead smaller particles. If large enough may reach nearby walls high velocity smaller particles slowed air drag hit walls less impact. Fine particles order tens microns may never reach instabilities also may play significant role process jetting may observed process See example Ref. 2 3. Hydrodynamic dispersion processes may numerically simulated except extremely high mass density multiphase turbulent flow-fields complicate picture. In final stage larger fragments smaller fragments react differently discussed detail next section. Fine particles may get ignited react vicinity detonating HE charge may fly unignited blast wave reflected wall engulf higher temperature surrounding. Larger fragments may get ignited near walls impact -- may broken small pieces get mixed ignited nearby air. These reactions topic paper. Work detailed understanding SEMs behave recently begun.

This reaction called IIR 1st kind. Another type reaction IIR 2nd kind occurs large heavy fragment goes thin skin target partially breaks hits solid wall goes deformation break-up mixes air ignites burns. Figure 2 depicts IIR Fragments large large dots shown left top therefore fly ahead shock front dotted lines. Many small dots behind shock front represent smaller fragments. Similar large fragments hitting right wall floor broken smaller pieces may get ignited conditions right. This IIR 1st kind. The fragments intentionally sampled thin volume space depth paper show handful large fragments. Their masses 3-4 orders magnitude larger smaller particles. Fig. 2. A configuration potential IIR 1st Often total energy released given SEM depends types reactions together FPR IIR. However shown certain types SEM reacts via IIR types react exclusively FPR. Some fuel particles SEM may react either mode FPR IIR. In case IIR large fuel particles perhaps large mechanical strengths may see inelastic walls strike walls sufficient speed break smaller particles. Even strike break may bounce strongly enough sufficiently mixed air around undergo full reaction. In case FPR small particles may closely packed may see enough hot gasses chance get heated enough gas heating cools down. Even reach high temperatures may enough oxidizing gases full reaction. Oxygen availability fuel particles ignitability reaction rate important issues either type The desired performance SEMs maximize either types reactions FPR IIR sufficiently short times maximize strength blast generated HESEM charge b applications maximize temperature field andor pressure field given space. This paper focusses blast aspects An example IIR SEM In paper two basic types reactions FPR 1st kind IIR 1st kind configurations. FPR 2nd kind demonstrated numerical simulations clear actual demonstration yet. It discussed further. IIR 2nd kind different name reported elsewhere also discussed here. Figure 3.

It expected SEM-1 fragments would fly faster case Figure 5 thus strike walls stronger forces. The strength IIR expected depend well fragments disintegrate upon impact much broken particles rebound mix surrounding air. The severe plastic deformation breakup process assumed provide stronger heating particles broken particles readily ignite burn. Therefore extent IIR HE-3 expected stronger HE-2.

First peak pressure arrival times strengths two dish type gauge locations average quasistatic pressure chamber estimated energy release SEM-1 SEM-2. The estimated energy combustion energy release SEM-2 FPR without additional IIR 2209 calg. This twice much energy density comparable TNT detonation. total energy released detonation afterburn enhanced blast afterburning fuel particles detonation. This strong implications design blast warheads. If half energy released propagation time blast HE detonation blast energy half total energy released means 1 lb SEM-2 would generate nearly strong blast 0.5 lb powerful EBX would. Consider warhead made 100 lbs explosive 300 lbs steel case. When warhead detonates open according Fano equation modified Fano equation Ref. 16 equivalent explosive weight EEW blast 50 lbs fragments take away 50 HE energy form kinetic energy. If case made SEM-2 warhead would thus 50 lbs Fano EEW 150 lbs SEM energy 3000.5 200 lbs EEW. Thus SEM-2 warhead EEW 200 lbs would 4 times EEW steel Roughly stated EEW SEM-2 warhead casing-mass-to-HE-mass MC ratio essentially MC1 times equivalent steel case warhead. If penetrating weapon larger MC benefit larger. Even weapon MC1 blast effect doubled. If blast flow time longer energy released within time larger therefore EEW even larger estimate. The 2209 calg mentioned impressive considered total available combustion energy SEM-2 clear reaction still fully complete. This means although SEM-2 performed well gained improve overall efficiency SEMs. It hope understanding going SEMs Figure 7. UIUC closed test chamber. Repeatability tests good within 10 peak pressures. The gauges placed dish-shaped mounts facing HESEM charge sideways particular interest. If fine particle reaction FPR fine fuel particles generated time HE detonation get ignited burn fast enough time blast thedetonation charge enhanced. These gauges would pick enhanced pressures including first pressure peak IIR generated walls farther away charge. One special feature UIUC test setup fully confined. This fact using measured quasistatic pressures second last column data allows estimate total energy released test event. Quasi-static pressure histories shown would also indicate duration reaction. The last column table shows estimated energy release per mass SEM. The estimated energy release SEM-1 IIR 625 calg far full combustion energy. This means although reaction takes place IIR various reasons mentioned FPR IIR section small portion SEM-1 goes reaction process. entire combustion process improve ingredients manufacturing processes sufficiently achieve higher efficiencies. Limitations FPR IIR The desired fragments sizes fuel particle reaction FPR IIR estimated follows. Initial blast events 10-20 lbs warheads occur within 20 milliseconds less evidenced Figures 5a 6 above. For much larger warheads initial blast events occur 100 ms so. For fuel particles contribute initial phase blasts react deliver energy less Figure 8 Ref. 17 shows burn times aluminum particles air example fuel particles. The data plot obtained oxidizing gases air. Assuming data applicable burning Al particles explosive products shocked air means sizes two hundred microns even largest warheads finish reacting within time frame. An SEM larger Al particles 100 microns may take long time 30 ms provide significant support blast field. An example given Fig. 4 wall reflections taken gauge close charge shows reaction time within couple milliseconds. Figure 8. Aluminum particle combustion times air There technical challenges obtaining sufficiently strong IIR. In open seen IIR doesnt happen much all. Fragments need high enough velocities strike walls break fine enough particles bounce back sufficiently walls get ignited burn short enough time contribute blast wave. IIR may happen walls stronghard enough break large fragments fine particles. The mechanism secondary fragmentation upon walltarget impact needs known understand entire process. The temperature rebounding fine particles high enough get ignited come contact atmospheric oxygen. The rebound velocity fine particles high fine particles would crowded around wall. Even ignited crowded mass reaction would slow reaction may even get quenched use local oxygen. Flow turbulence may help alleviate problem. For strong IIR fragments slowed much hitting walls. Larger fragments would better regard. These high velocity large fragments may able undergo extensive breakup fine particles. High stress large strain breakup high velocity fragments may help increase temperature broken particles absorbing plastic deformation energy breakup. lower MC warhead would generate higher fragment velocities may increase strength IIR reaction evidenced Zhang Ref. 6. FPR least 1st kind depend target conditions much IIR reliable mode operation SEM weapons. However FPR case still challenges well. As mentioned needs generate fine particles HE detonation adjacent SEM material. However fine particles tend slow quickly soon follow motion gas around them. deceleration fast particle density could much higher gas density around time surrounding gas. If particles would use oxygen gas would stop burning. Once flow turbulence downstream may alleviate problem. Addition FPR 2nd kind may help Figure 1 showed SHAMRC numerical simulation expansion fine powder ring mean diameter tens microns less coming hypothetical SEM. The SEM case mass 1.5 times HE-1. A snapshot density taken 1 ms powder ring left side reaches 20-25 times diameter original SEM case. The density fuel particle ring order 1 original SEM density time still order magnitude higher surrounding air density. This means enough air around particles full particle reaction. If SEM mass much larger HE mass situation gets worse. Velocity plots gas particles indicate particles already moving almost together surrounding gasses time. The right side Figure 1 showed turbulent mixing gasses bottom right particle ring blast wave detonation reflected walls. As stated turbulence subsequent reaction heated gas behind reflected blast wave FPR 2nd kind may alleviate initial slow reaction problem. Thus shown strength FPR also affected target configurations. It shown newly developed SEMs generate strong blasts confined spaces. Weapons built SEMs would effective targets bunkers buildings underground structures. Weapon prototypes built tested currently. They react two distinct modes fineparticle reaction FPR fine fuel particles impact-induced reaction IIR large fragments. Both types reactions challenges limitations.

A structural reactive material SRM defined possess high energy material density well structural strength. Often SRM metallurgically made grain-scale reactive metals metal-oxides sometimes inert metal additives SRM bears bulk meso-scale properties. As SRM-cased explosive charge detonates casing fragmentation deliver high speed fragments Combustion reactive fragments effectively contribute air blast depending reaction mechanism fragment material also sizes concentration fragments. One key parameters SRM-cased explosive charge mass ratio casing explosive MC.2 For continuum aluminum Al casing free-field blast enhancement reported mostly thin casings small MC values resulted fine fragments combust. Little augmentation air blast observed free field thick Al casings MC 1.75 majority primary fragments relatively large thus function inert material. Blast enhancement thick casings observed confined environments fragment impact targets whereby generated combustion. Additional mechanisms therefore desired order create primary secondary fine fragments efficient energy release large MC casings. One sub-fragmentation mechanisms uses impedance mismatch within SRM microscale multiple ingredients.34 In small-scale tests3 cold iso-statically pressed rings 4-30 AlTungsten granular composite provided fragment sizes order hundred micrometers explosive loading. This attributed large velocity gradients developed impedance materials structure discontinuities. Using 3.5 kg thick casing NiAl laminate composite 50-150 layer thickness4 explosive loading depicted significantly enhanced blast front pressures near-field. In case shock dynamics interfaces different impedance ingredients resulted nonuniform high local temperatures stresses late times dissimilar inertia led different accelerations. Sub-fragmentation depends meso-scale structure dissimilar ingredients. In present work another mechanism studied using micro-scale reactive hot spots intruded base SRM casing initiate local fractures leading fine SRM fragments. Theoretical Consideration In order generate fine primary secondary fragments increase energy release efficiency thick SRM casing explosive loading concept hot spots within base SRM considered. This could achieved distributing micro-scale reactive material particles base SRM fuel rich equivalence ratio. During casing fragmentation upon charge detonation impact primary fragments target reaction particles would create heat gas products form micro-scale hot spots whose expansion initiates local failure fractures leading fine SRM fragments. Due fuel rich ratio SRM added hot spot material produced fine fragments would mostly original SRM rapidly combust air provide energy output. Al Copper oxide CuO particles chosen interposed base Al due reaction heat amount high temperature gas products O O2 AlO Al2O etc. Assuming reaction Al-CuO dominated diffusion local reactions around distributed particles would near stoichiometric atomic ratio NAlNCuO 23 resulting heat reaction 4.077 kJg. The equilibrium explosion temperature estimated 4640 K constant volume theoretical material density TMD phase changes. In previous work5 diffusiondominated reaction reported responsible combustion propagation cold-sprayed AlCuO composite density approached TMD. Numerical simulations performed examine concept feasibility. A 1.25 x 0.5 mm planar 2D slab model used represent hot spots base material. Hot spots modeled ellipses 50 x 100 dimension filled stoichiometric Al-CuO. The spacing hot spots filled Al set target volume fraction 0.331 coincide overall fuel-rich atomic ratio NAlNCuO 2.5.

The products hot spot combustion modeled using JWL equation state expansion fitting Cheetah code. An Eulerian multi-material numerical equilibrium mixed states. The hydrodynamic response include strength effects since pressure exceeded material yield strength order magnitude. If hot spot particles react immediately upon detonation shock entering casing impacting expansion hot spots would slow due resistance highly shocked pressures surrounding base Al. A reaction delay hot spot particles may therefore preferred allow sufficient decay shocked pressures base Al. Thus reaction hot spot particles assumed reasonable delay casing expanded near failure 50100 typical Al casings right primary fragmentation whereby pressure approaches ambient. For simplicity initial condition approximated static 1 atm since calculated pressure values regarded pressure ratios initial higher initial pressures. After reaction delay reaction assumed take place instantly provide hot spots constant volume explosion state.

In recent vacuum experimental study6 ignition temperatures found similar arrest-reactive-milled nanocomposites 2Al3CuO 4AlFe2O3 8AlMoO3 2.35AlBi2O3 range 800950 K around Al melting point. The study also indicated likelihood low-temperature redox reactions occurring prior ignition prone rapid decomposition upon heating. Under charge detonation condition bulk shocked temperature casing may reach thermite ignition temperature. However dissimilar impedance materials discontinuities micro voids porosity SRM casing enhance shock dissipation deformation casing failure resulting high temperatures beyond ignition threshold hot spot material.

In addition goal quantify violence lightly confined unsealed experiments supply experimental data validation ALE3D explosion modeling. The sealed kbar experiment interesting demonstrated weakening vessel strength help mitigate violence. When interior pressure exceeded vessel confinement whole vessel failed vent rapid. Because material quite reached burn stage damage minimal. In designing safer casing materials vessel fail release uniformly quickly may best option minimal damage. The vented kbar surprisingly violent. Our vent designed allow pressure equilibration heating stages restrictive thermal explosion allow much mitigation violence. The vent worked designed result violent explosion. Our hypothesis material allowed fully ignite vented experiment ignited produced violent One general question remains whether venting explosives enhance mitigate violence. Our previous STEX experiments HMX-based formulations indicate vent leak little change violence explosive.1 We hypothesize explosive ignition point center charge inertial confinement helps contain reactive gases thermally insulate ignition point. As leak vent vessel wallseals little change explosion. In particular pressure rises ignition point inertial confinement prevents pressure pushing vessel walls releasing via vent. In contrast pressure rises center liquid charge quickly transferred walls vessel. The pressure rise ignition point either relieved via vent pushing vessel walls. Based logic one would surmise many liquid explosives might violent allowed small vent may mitigated via substantial vent easily destroyed vessel wall.

For efficient effective development new formulations safety assessments munitions necessary understand effect characteristics constituent materials safety properties formulation. The particle size explosives determine response formulations thermal mechanical frictional electrical shock stimuli. To characterize understand effect HMX particle size thermal response five HMX contained proportion HMX particle size distributions varied. Spherical charges formulations held confinement constant elevated temperatures One-Dimensional Time-To-Explosion apparatus. The explosion measured ranged seconds several Numerical simulations accurately described time-to-explosion behavior used rationalize effect particle size thermal response formulations All explosives given right conditions capable rapid potentially violent release explosive must characterized conditions leading understanding appropriate precautions put place ensure processing operational reactions understood. From main motivation characterizing modeling thermal response explosives support assessment munitions thermal threats example fuel fires. Assessments address If explosive response occur time explosion explosive response? It would prohibitively expensive evaluate response prototype munition thermal threats experimentally. Even scope experimental munitionlevel characterization programme reduced supplemented small scale trials means applying experimental results threats configurations would required. However fundamental understanding chemical physical processes determining response explosive formulation provide means rationalize experimental results predict response formulation warhead geometries configurations. The increase computing power development higher fidelity experimental characterization techniques provided tools increasing complexity hence predictive capability In accident energy imparted explosive. The energy transferred explosive shock mechanical impact friction heating electrical interactions interactions result localized heating explosive charge. Therefore response explosives decomposition models required. thermal decomposition To develop thermal decomposition model requires factors could affect thermal decomposition identified significance contribution assessed. The requirements model determine factors need incorporated model. Time explosion models HMX based explosives developed successfully applied assessment response munitions thermal capability models extend understand role HMX particle size deemed necessary Changing HMX particle size decreasing HMX particle size decreases shock initiation threshold short duration pulses whereas long duration pulses increases threshold. Alternatively shown elimination coarse HMX particles plastic bonded explosives lead high power high explosive HE formulations react less violently mechanical stimuli. Karpowicz Brill2 Fifer3 proposed two opposite theories rationalize effect HMX particle size thermal decomposition intermediates products crystal structure. Whilst Karpowicz Brill2 argue destabilizes theories based crystal lattice promotes decomposition Fifer maintained stabilizing effect enables recombination HMX occur.

In form crystals could considered independent mobility decomposition intermediates within crystal ability escape crystal would affected adjacent particles. However time explosion measurements described performed HMX charges pressed high density 90-95 TMD gas-tight sealed cavity voids charge confinement anvils. These conditions would significantly reduce ability decomposition intermediates escape crystals From work presented paper possible reconcile particle size trends HMX transition crystals times explosions charges. However speculated high density confined charges effect particle size rate reaction becomes significant determining times explosion known reaction rate increases decreasing size increasing surface area8. Further work required study quantify effect HMX particle size times explosion function charge density free volume within ODTX charge cavity would provide insight controlling mechanisms. Predicting effect particle size times explosion charges complicated. A charge contain HMX particles range sizes different thermal sensitivities.

Irrespective form energy imparted explosive accident e.g. kinetic energy case mechanical impacts energy ultimately converted thermal energy.

Typically powder samples used particle size distribution formulation. However powder pressed charge particle size distribution modified. The compressive strength particles elastic materials decreases increasing size. Kendall12 predicted materials fracture stress would inversely proportional size.

Frictional heating high-melting-point grit particles glancing impacts polymer-bonded explosives PBX considered major source ignition serious accidents involving dropped otherwise mishandled explosives. It accepted knowledge since series experiments Bowden lowest temperature melting point two frictionally interacting surfaces cap maximum temperature reached. This offers seemingly easy way mitigate dangers glancing impacts using surfaces andor barriers melting points ignition temperature PBX temperature necessary form Frank-Kamenetskii critical hot spot function impact duration. However recent series skid testing experiments shown ignition occur gritty low-melting-point surfaces propagate violent reaction. The mechanism thought responsible ignition low-melting-point surfaces grit-grit collisions release enough heat lead ignition PBX. Experimental evidence presented includes impact experiments onto single grit particles collisions possible impacts onto heavily sanded surfaces grit-grit collisions possible post-mortem microscopy showing collision sites impacts onto heavily sanded targets probabilistic arguments built series simple assumptions indicating areal grit-coverage density tested grit-grit collisions One major causes serious accidents involving energetic materials due oblique impacts dropped mishandled consolidated explosives. It common misbelief explosives community ignition events due one two mechanisms heating caused mechanical deformation explosive frictional heating explosive directly interacting impacted surface. However neither mechanisms responsible ignition time frame impact typically around 1 ms. Above minimum ignition temperature time-to-ignition HMX-based explosives directly related temperature logt 1T1. In order ignition occur timescale impact event temperatures excess around 600C required. The lower temperature hot spots cool quench surfaces lose contact Since PBXs weak solids requires relatively little energy deform plastically. This temperature accessible mechanical deformation since strain rates involved reasonable dropped explosive scenarios low give rise required temperature ignition. The maximum temperature reached frictional heating due interaction explosive clean substrate capped melting point explosive2. For HMX-based explosives approximately 260C low lead critical hot spot formation. Multiple skid tests clean surfaces performed ignition never observed surface free grit3 4.

Table summarizing explosive polymers used test series The Grit-Grit Mechanism Several possible mechanisms exist gritmediated ignition low-melting-point surfaces including energy released due fracturing substrate viscous-shear heating molten substrate. However multiple experiments performed single grit particle struck low-melting-point substrates ignition observed. Single grit experiments high-melting-point surfaces glass result ignition see Fig. 5 seems imply grit-substrate interaction low-melting-point surfaces lead directly ignition. grit-substrate interaction responsible ignition low-melting-point surfaces mechanism appears either highly stochastic due yet undetermined effect large number grit particles interacting substrate. Currently leading hypothesis ignition low-melting-point surfaces grit-grit collisions release enough energy lead ignition several mechanisms. These mechanisms could energy released fracturing grit particles due frictional energy two interacting particles. Friction two particles seems less likely lead ignition due small size particles particles rub together short time limit amount heat produced8. While experimentally veried modelled surmised shattering particle release enough heat ignite PBX relevant time scale. It could possible multiple collisions must occur within certain radius impact ignition occur. The exact mechanism ignition due gritgrit collision fully determined time subject investigation.

For impacted substrates softer PBX ignition observed since grit embedded PBX possibility grit-grit collision occurring supports idea grit-grit collisions responsible ignition. This offers possible means mitigating hazard ignition due glancing impacts covering highmelting-point surfaces low-melting-point materials softer PBX handled. Also impacts soft surfaces lower peak normal force experienced explosive. The force transducer data collected indicates normal force exerted drop glass almost twice soft AdipreneTM. However one could speculate PBX charge mishandled grit particles become embedded PBX drop grit-grit collisions occur dirty soft surfaces. The reduction normal force reduce energy released due grit-grit collisions possibly reduce hazard scenario. However contact area tween PBX substrate much higher soft surfaces. This increase connement event ignition could possibly increase risk propagating violent reaction. noted line reasoning entirely speculative. Probability Grit-Grit Collisions The grit-grit collision mechanism highly stochastic dependent variables angle grit-grit collision glancing impacts versus normal impacts number collisions shape strength individual grit particles among others. Due multi-scale nature event spans grain scale macroscopic difcult capture variables current experimental setup. However possible calculate probability grit-grit collision grit density grit size drop height impact angle known.

At areal densities drop heights probability one grit-grit collisions approaches one see Fig. 8 .

The xed parameters particle size r 250m probability moving p 0.50 frame ignite PBX. This hypothesis supported three main pieces evidence well micrographs showing collision sites. First single grit experiments carried high low-melting-point substrates ignition observed high-meltingpoint surfaces. On low-melting-point surfaces ignition observed seems eliminate grit-surface interaction responsible mechanism ignition. This expected since shown two frictionally interacting materials maximum temperature reached capped lowest melting point two surfaces. Second experiments ignition observed grit particles embedded PBX substrate gives possibility collision occurring. In materials softer PBX grit particles embedded preferentially substrate PBX. This means grit-grit collision could occur cases ignition observed. Third also possible calculate probability grit-grit collision occurring given areal grit density known. For tests ignition observed probability grit-grit collision close one likely multiple collisions occurring. As mentioned cases collisions unlikely ignition observed. Armed knowledge possible mitigate dangers oblique impacts. Since current series tests indicates grit-grit hazard greatly reduced substrates softer PBX would possible use soft lowmelting-point surface coverings e.g. rubber mats mitigate hazard. Thisused conjunction appropriate cleanliness standards set Eq. 1 gives clear means controlling one main hazards handling energetic materials. 7. Frank-Kamenetskii D. A.

In range actual velocity close CJ limit. Although ignition growth model under-predicted velocity model show detonation failure non-ideal behavior 60 TMD. The error velocity ignition growth likely result modifications used run P- porosity model could improved recalibrating rate constants. Another conclusion simulations Arrhenius history variable reactive burn models predict thin reaction zones order tens microns. Not thin reaction zones require higher mesh densities grid independent solutions fail predict trends drop velocity 60 TMD physically correct.
